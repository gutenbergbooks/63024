</div>
<p class='c010'>The comfortable sitting room in Durfee Hall, occupied
by Dick Merriwell and his Texas chum, Brad
Buckhart, was filled to overflowing. Sprawling among
the cushions of the divan was Rudolph Rose, handsome,
high-spirited, and rather quick-tempered, but
happy in the knowledge that he had at last conquered
the latter failing and thereby won a place in Merriwell’s
friendship.</p>

<p class='c002'>Close beside him was Terry Baxter, quiet, almost too
serious, but with a keen sense of humor which showed
in the appreciative gleam in his brown eyes and the
occasional terse, pithy remarks which he uttered in a
solemn manner, but which invariably sent the others
into an uproar.</p>

<p class='c002'>Eric Fitzgerald, slim, slight, and curly haired, dangled
his legs from one end of the table. He was so
full of vim and life and go that he reminded one of
a particle of quicksilver, forever on the move; and on
the rare occasions when he did settle down for a moment,
he usually perched himself somewhere in a temporary
manner, as if he were only pausing for an
instant before making another flight.</p>

<p class='c002'>Samp Elwell, the Hoosier, whose dry wit was a
source of never-ending delight to his friends, occupied
the piano stool. Across the room sat his chum, Lance
Fair, who was not nearly so unsophisticated as his
smooth, rosy cheeks and almost girlish manner would
lead one to imagine.</p>

<p class='c002'>Buckhart was hunched down on the back of his neck
in one of the big easy-chairs near the table, while
Merriwell himself was tilted back against the wall in
the desk chair, his dark eyes sparkling with mirth and
a smile curving the corners of his sensitive mouth.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You fellows ought to have been in Pierson’s classroom
this morning,” he remarked. “After the lecture
he started in to quiz us, and happened to spy Hollister
gazing dreamily out of the window. I suppose Bob
was thinking out some new football stunt. Anyway,
he was miles away from Roman history, and Pierson
caught him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“‘Mr. Hollister,’ he said, in that short, snappy way
he has, ‘can you mention one memorable date in Roman
history?’</p>

<p class='c002'>“Bob came out of his trance with a jump and
snapped back without thinking, ‘Anthony’s with Cleopatra,
sir.’ It brought down the house.”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a shout of delighted laughter, and when
it had died down Samp Elwell looked up, grinning.</p>

<p class='c002'>“He did,” chimed in Fitzgerald from the table.
“Piercy was mad as thunder. It isn’t the first time
Bob’s flunked by a long shot, either. He’s been awful
punky this term.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’d like to have seen old Pierson’s face,” he chuckled.
“I reckon Bob drew a goose egg for that.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Too much football, I opine,” growled the Texan.
“He can’t get his mind off the game long enough to
feed his face, let alone keep track of lectures. He’s
plumb locoed about it. You hear me gently warble!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, say,” Elwell spoke up suddenly; “how about
that new stunt of old Bill’s. That forward——”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Texan straightened up like a flash, and, grabbing
a book from the table, shied it with swiftness and
remarkable accuracy at the Hoosier’s head. Elwell
ducked, and the book struck the piano, falling to the
keyboard with a discordant crash.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What in time——” began the indignant sophomore,
straightening up again.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You don’t seem to recollect what I tried to drill
into that solid ivory skull of yours a brief time back,”
Buckhart drawled with perfect composure. “Talking
shop has got to be cut out around this bunk house.
I’m plumb sick of hearing about football. For six
weeks I’ve heard nothing else, and now that Tempest is
back on the job I’m going to take a rest.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great Scott, Brad!” Rose exclaimed aghast.
“You’re not going to leave the team!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thunderation, no!” the Texan retorted. “I’ll hold
down my job till the cows come home; but off the field
I’m going to forget it and take a whack at the books
I have hardly got a squint at since the term began. So,
unless you gents want to start a row promiscuous like,
kindly refrain from holding forth on the subject while
I’m around.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Say, fellows, isn’t it pretty near time we organized
a little fishing party up to the lake?” asked Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class='c002'>Trout fishing was one of his pet hobbies.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Any trout there?” inquired Fair quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thousands of ’em,” returned Fitz.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Will they bite easily?” asked Lance.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Will they?” exclaimed the slim chap. “Well, I
should say they would! Why, they’re absolutely vicious.
A man has to hide behind a tree to bait his
hook.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“It wouldn’t be a bad idea,” Dick remarked. “We
haven’t gone on a trip like that this fall. Say,
Samp, why don’t you take a comfortable chair?
You’ve been holding down that piano stool all evening,
and you know you can’t play a note.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Hoosier winked significantly and cast a meaning
glance at Fitzgerald, one of whose many accomplishments
was the singing of popular ditties to improvised
accompaniments consisting of a more or less
skillful variation of two chords.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I know that,” Elwell returned composedly, “but
neither can any one else while I’m here.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitz instantly took up the gantlet.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Talk about hogs!” he exclaimed, springing from his
seat on the table. “And here I am fairly bursting with
a perfectly punk song I just learned this afternoon.
Avaunt, creature!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He made a dive at Elwell, and, before the stalwart
Hoosier realized what was happening, the piano stool
was deftly upset and he sprawled on the floor. By
the time he had scrambled to his feet, the slim chap was
seated calmly at the keyboard and had struck an opening
chord.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come into the garden, Maud,” he began dramatically.
He got no farther. A united yell of protest
arose which effectually drowned him out.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, what a chestnut!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Noah sang that to the animals in the ark!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Give us something that’s not more than two thousand
years old!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitz turned slowly around, a look of pained surprise
on his freckled face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Peace, prithee—peace!” he chided. “I assure you
that the song is quite new, save the first line, which
may be a little reminiscent. Kindly refrain from any
more rude, vulgar interruptions.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Before the others could recover their breath he
struck the chords and began to sing again, this time
rather hurriedly:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Come into the garden, Maud”;</div>
      <div class='line in3'>But Maud was much too wise.</div>
      <div class='line'>‘Oh, no,’ said she, ‘the corn has ears</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And the potatoes eyes.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>His voice, dwelling lingeringly and fondly on the last
note, was drowned in a shout of laughter.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great!” choked Buckhart. “Maud was a wise
child, all right.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Give us another verse, old fellow,” chuckled Elwell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m afraid I’m not in very good voice to-night,”
simpered Fitz, looking coyly down at the keys. “Such
a critical audience always makes me so nervous. However——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He lifted his voice again in the same serious chant.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The rain it falls upon the just,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And also on the unjust fellers;</div>
      <div class='line'>But chiefly on the just, because</div>
      <div class='line in2'>The unjust have the justs’ umbrellers.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>This verse was received with equal applause, and
Fitz was entreated to give them another.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sing another song,” urged Rose. “You must know
a pile of them.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, I’ll give you a very short one,” the slim chap
returned with much apparent reluctance. “It’s a little
old, but you mustn’t mind a thing like that.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Striking a single chord, he began the first line.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mary had a little——”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>He paused, and, clearing his throat, glanced around
at his audience, plainly surprised that there had been
no interruption. Having been caught once, however,
the fellows were not going to repeat the performance,
and remained expectantly silent.</p>

<p class='c002'>Seeing that he could not get a rise out of them,
Fitzgerald turned back to the piano and began the
song over again.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Mary had a little skirt</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Tied tightly in a bow,</div>
      <div class='line'>And everywhere that Mary went</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She simply couldn’t go.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“That’s all,” he announced, springing up and skipping
over to the table again. “Somebody else can do
parlor tricks now.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Before any one had a chance to reply, the door was
opened rather unceremoniously, and a tall, curly haired,
sun-burned fellow, with an attractive face and the
figure of an athlete, entered composedly, and closed
the door behind him.</p>

<p class='c002'>From the uproarious nature of the greeting he received,
it was quite evident that he was a general favorite.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hello, Bob!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come in and rest your face and hands.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“How about Anthony’s date with Cleopatra?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Bob Hollister grinned a little sheepishly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Heard about that, have you?” he inquired, as he
dropped down on a chair. “I suppose that’ll be rubbed
into me for the next six months. What the deuce did
I know about Roman history? I was doping out a new
around-the-end combination.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sh! Careful!” cautioned Elwell, with upraised
finger.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister looked bewildered.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s the matter?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No football talk,” returned the Hoosier, with a
grin. “Our esteemed, ex-temporary captain objects to
it in the sacred privacy of his apartment.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, I’ll be hanged!” gasped Hollister. “Not talk
about football! What in the mischief else is there to
talk about?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You have got it bad, Bob,” he remarked. “Don’t
you ever think about anything else?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister shook his head.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hardly ever,” he confessed. “I couldn’t keep it
out of my head if I tried, with the big game so close.
Why, I even wake up in the middle of the night wondering
how to work certain combinations, or thinking
up some new way of getting the ball through their line.
I haven’t had time to open a book in weeks.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He gave a sudden start, and, diving down into one
pocket, drew out a rather crumpled envelope.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just look at that,” he remarked, tossing it over to
Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell caught it and extracted a square, printed
slip, which proved to be one of the warning notices
sent out from the dean’s office when a student has
fallen behind the required grade in any particular
study.</p>

<p class='c002'>“A warning in Latin,” he said thoughtfully. “You
must have been pretty rotten lately, Bob. Goodhue is
one of the easiest profs in college.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I have flunked a bunch of times,” Hollister confessed.
“And that isn’t all, either. Got one in German
day before yesterday. I suppose Schlemmer got
on his ear after the mess I made of Heine last week.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You want to look out, Bobby,” Fitzgerald put in
lightly. “After this morning, you’re due for still another.
Dear old Piercy was purple when you made
that cute remark about Anthony’s date. I’ll bet he hot-footed
to the dean the minute the class was over.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“And three warnings means a general one,” supplemented
Elwell. “By hocus, Bobby! You’ll have to do
a little cramming, or you’ll have the whole faculty
down on your neck.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“They are now!” Hollister burst out petulantly. “I
believe it’s a put-up job. Every one of them takes a
special delight in getting me up every chance they can
and making a monkey out of me. They ought to know
I don’t have any chance to grind right in the middle
of the football season. But what do they care about
football! A lot of dried-up fossils! They don’t give
a rap whether we’re licked or not. I don’t believe the
biggest part of ’em even see one game a season.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re wrong there, Bob,” Dick put in quietly.
“Some of the profs are daffy about the game. The
dean wouldn’t miss one for any amount of money.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, and old Piercy is the worst of the lot,” chimed
in Fitzgerald. “You ought to have seen him Saturday—standing
up on the bench, his hat off, hair rumpled,
and eyes popping out of his head, waving his
arms like a windmill, and yelling like a fiend. He’s
a good old sport, even if he does like to catch a fellow
napping in the classroom.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The clock struck ten, and the sound had scarcely
died away when Buckhart threw out his arms and
yawned, loudly and ostentatiously.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Humph!” remarked Fitzgerald tartly. “Why don’t
you tell us plainly that it’s time to go home?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I was waiting to see if you wouldn’t wake up to
the fact yourselves,” the Texan returned tranquilly.</p>

<p class='c002'>The slim chap eyed him mischievously.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ve a good mind to stay here just to spite you,”
he said presently.</p>

<p class='c002'>Buckhart yawned again.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Stay right along, if you like, little one,” he drawled.
“That wouldn’t bother me a whole lot. In about ten
minutes I’m going to hit the pillow; but if you gents
want to sit here for the rest of the night chinning,
you’ve sure got my permission.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Most of the other fellows were about ready to turn
in themselves, and there was a general movement toward
the door. Hollister got up with the rest, and
then glanced hesitatingly toward Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Got a couple of minutes to spare, Dick?” he asked,
in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sure thing,” Merriwell returned quickly. “Sit
down and I’ll be with you in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister dropped back onto his chair, and Dick
followed the others to the door. With a chorus of
good nights, they trooped out in a body and clattered
downstairs. Then Merriwell came back into the room
and resumed his seat, while Buckhart made tracks for
the bedroom.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You gents will have to excuse me,” he mumbled.
“Can’t keep my blinkers propped open another minute.
Good night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without waiting for their response, he disappeared,
and the next moment the sound of shoes being thrown
to the floor was heard, followed with amazing swiftness
by the creak of springs as the Texan crawled into
bed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Gee! I wish I could do that,” Hollister murmured.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick raised his eyebrows inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Go to sleep the minute I hit the pillow,” Hollister
explained. “I toss around for an hour or more, thinking
about all kinds of things. Seems as if I could
think better at night when everything’s quiet and
there’s no one to disturb me.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Football, I suppose?” Dick questioned, looking at
him thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, but that wasn’t what I wanted to talk to you
about,” he said quickly. “It’s these confounded warnings.
I never got one of them before this fall.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His tone was almost angry.</p>

<p class='c002'>“As I remember,” Dick remarked, “you never used
to have any trouble keeping up in your studies, but
still had plenty of time for almost anything in the line
of athletics you wanted to do.”</p>

<p class='c002'>A frown corrugated Hollister’s forehead.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Exactly,” he returned. “It looks to me as if the
profs did the thing on purpose just to worry me when
they ought to know I’ve got to give all my time to football.
It’s a rotten shame!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick did not answer for a moment.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I hardly think that’s it, Bob,” he said presently.
“There wouldn’t be any object in their doing that. I
don’t believe they like giving a fellow’s name to the
dean. I know Goodhue doesn’t, for he’s told me so.
He doesn’t have a man warned until it’s absolutely
necessary. No, I’m afraid the trouble is altogether
with you. You don’t bone enough.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister smiled wryly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t grind at all,” he said quickly. “Somehow,
there doesn’t seem to be any time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Shucks! You’ve got as much time as the rest of
us. Somehow we manage to make a passable showing.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister flushed a little.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I suppose I have got the time,” he said slowly, “but
I can’t seem to make use of it. The minute I sit down
with a book, my mind flies off to the field as regular
as clockwork, and before I know it it’s time to turn
in, and I haven’t done an earthly thing with the Latin
or math, or whatever it may be; but very likely I’ve
thought out some corking new formation or trick
play.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I see,” Dick said quietly; “but what good does it
all do?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Good!” exclaimed Hollister, in surprise. “Why, I
put the idea up to Tempest or Fullerton, and often
they can make use of it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course I know that,” Dick returned. “There
isn’t a fellow on the team who has a better, broader
conception of the strategy of the game; but you’re
not in college just to play football and let everything
else go to smash. That sounds sort of priggish, I
know, but it’s really the truth. What you’ve got to
do is to put it out of your mind the moment you leave
the field. If you don’t, Bob, you’ll be plucked as sure
as fate.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Brad has realized that, and you know there isn’t
a fellow in college who thinks more of the game.
But while he was taking Tempest’s place as captain,
he just about dropped everything else and got frightfully
behind in his work. Since Don came back last
week, Brad has been doing his best not to think of
football except on the field, and he’s done such a lot
of hard grinding that he’s beginning to catch up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s what I ought to do, of course,” Hollister
agreed. “But I don’t see how I can, Dick. I start in,
really intending to study, but somehow, I never get
anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s all nonsense,” Dick said emphatically. “You
can do it if you really make up your mind to. Great
Scott, man! You don’t want to develop into a fellow
with just one idea, do you? If you keep on this
way, you won’t be able to think of another earthly
thing but football. And if you don’t take a brace in
your real work, you’re more than likely to be dropped.
Then where would you be?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister’s face had grown very serious. He seemed
to realize for the first time the gravity of the situation
and the end toward which he was rapidly drifting.
Somehow it had never occurred to him that there was
a possibility of being dropped. If that should happen,
what earthly good would his ability to play football
be to him? It was not a pleasant thought.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I expect you’re right, old man,” he said slowly,
with a rather futile attempt at a smile. “Looks as if
I’d have to take a big brace before something drops.
It’s going to be a hard pull, though.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course, it will be hard, Bob,” Dick said earnestly,
“but you’ve got to do it. Just make up your
mind that you positively won’t give the game a thought
off the field. Banish it entirely from your mind, and
take a fresh spurt with the books. Then I think you’ll
come out all right.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister arose slowly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s what I’ll do,” he said quickly; “at least,
that’s what I’ll try to do.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Don’t say try,” Merriwell put in swiftly. “Don’t
let there be a doubt in your mind of your ability to
succeed, and I think you’ll make good.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Right you are,” Hollister smiled. “I’ll start in to-morrow
morning. I’m awfully obliged, Dick, for your
advice. I didn’t seem to realize before how serious a
fix I was in, but I’ll pull up now, and I think things
will come around in good shape.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course, they will,” Merriwell answered heartily.
“See you to-morrow, old fellow. Good night.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE THIRD WARNING.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Bob Hollister played right end on the varsity, and
was one of the most valuable men on the team. He
was remarkably speedy, quite equaling the Indian,
Joe Crowfoot; absolutely tireless, with the added advantage
of having played the game ever since his prep
school days, so he was familiar with every phase of it.</p>

<p class='c002'>No matter in what apparently direful straits the
team might be, Bob never gave up hope. Not until the
final whistle blew, announcing that the game was finished,
would he acknowledge that he was beaten, and
his cheery optimism always had an inspiring effect on
the discouraged members of the team, more than once
being the means of pulling them out of the slough of
despondency and changing defeat into victory.</p>

<p class='c002'>Perhaps more than anything else, the quality which
made him valuable was the fact that he never lost his
head. No matter what might be happening, Bob Hollister
could always be depended on to use his brains.
And not only did he use them to advantage during the
progress of a game, but he was noted for the ingenious
combinations and strategic plays which he worked out
and submitted to Bill Fullerton, the head coach.</p>

<p class='c002'>The latter had often remarked that Hollister had
either a perfectly phenomenal mind, or else he spent
his entire waking hours doping out these plays, so
many of which had proved invaluable to the eleven.</p>

<p class='c002'>His latter supposition had been the correct one.
Hollister’s brain did, indeed, work very quickly; and
that, together with his perfect knowledge of football,
enabled him to work out clever schemes in far less
time than the ordinary mortal; but what had at first
started as a more or less interesting pastime now
reached a point when it absorbed almost every conscious
moment.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick Merriwell’s words opened his eyes to the truth,
and, as he crossed the campus to his rooms in Vanderbilt,
he gave them very serious thought and attention.</p>

<p class='c002'>He would start in the very next day with the necessary
reform. He would do as Dick advised, and cut
out thinking about football except when he was on the
field. It was too bad the profs hadn’t let him alone
until after the end of the season, for then he could
have turned his attention to his books with a much
freer mind; but since they hadn’t, he must simply
make the best of it. It would be a hard pull, but he
did not doubt his ability to succeed.</p>

<p class='c002'><i>He went to sleep that night thinking over a new
variation of the forward pass.</i></p>

<p class='c002'>Before leaving his rooms next morning, the expected
warning from the dean, regarding his extremely
poor showing in history, appeared.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister read it with an expression of whimsical
annoyance on his pleasant face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Darn his buttons!” he muttered. “Why couldn’t
Piercy have passed over that break of mine! He
might have known I wasn’t paying attention. I suppose
he thought I was trying to be funny and cod him.
Well, I’ll have to make the best of it. I hope he
doesn’t get after me again to-day, though. I haven’t
the most remote idea what his lecture was about yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Nor had he a much clearer conception of any of the
other recitations or lectures he was to attend that day,
and his face was rather glum as he ran downstairs
and out onto the campus. He was due at the chemical
lab at ten o’clock, and, as he hurried across one of
the walks, head down and thoughts, sad to say, very
far away from chemistry, he suddenly heard some one
calling his name.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s your hurry, Bob? Where you rushing
to?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister looked up quickly, and when he saw who
the speaker was, his face brightened.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hello, Jarv,” he said quickly. “I’m due at the lab
at ten o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“As it lacks just sixteen minutes of that hour, and
you can’t possibly use up more than five getting over
there, I fail to see the reason for your hurry,” commented
Jarvis Blake, as he continued to advance slowly
and leisurely. “I’m going there myself, but I don’t
propose to run my legs off.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He was a big, blond fellow, with thick, straight,
almost tow-colored hair, eyelashes and eyebrows so
light as to be nearly invisible. He wore a neatly
clipped yellow mustache, which was the exact color
of corn silk.</p>

<p class='c002'>His eyes were dark blue and set wide apart, his features
clean-cut and handsome, except that his mouth
was large and loosely set. He was one of the best
subs on the varsity and played an exceedingly good,
brainy game.</p>

<p class='c002'>Men about college said he had a pronounced case
of swelled head. Certainly he was not likely to undervalue
himself, but for all that he was well liked among
a certain class, and Hollister had always found him
genial and entertaining, a good fellow in every respect.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Didn’t know I had so much time,” the latter explained,
as they pursued their way along the walk together.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How are things?” inquired Jarvis. “Strikes me
you look a bit glum this morning.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister hesitated for an instant.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, it’s those warnings, I suppose,” he said, at
length. “I got the third one right after breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Blake whistled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, what have you been doing to get the profs
down on you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s what I haven’t done that’s got them going, I
reckon,” Hollister returned. “I don’t know as I blame
them much after the way I’ve flunked lately.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Rot!” exclaimed Blake emphatically. “You’re no
worse than half the other fellows in the class.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t know about that,” Hollister said doubtfully.
“I’d hate to count up the number of goose eggs I’ve
accumulated this term. You heard the fool thing I
said to Piercy yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Blake grinned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Say, that was sort of funny, wasn’t it?” he remarked.
“But anybody could see you weren’t paying
attention. You heard from old Pierson, then?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s the one I got this morning.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, I wouldn’t let a thing like that worry me,”
Blake went on quickly. “The profs don’t seem to
realize that a fellow can’t give much time to work
during the football season. They get down on a man,
too, and, once he flunks, they keep pounding him out
of sheer spite. I haven’t got any warnings so far, but
I’d be willing to bet that one or two will come along
within the next two weeks.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hope you don’t, I’m sure,” Hollister returned
absently. “There’s no doubt about it, though, I’ve got
to take a brace and cut out thinking about football at
all off the field, if I want to stay on with the class.”</p>

<p class='c002'>A look of dismay came into Blake’s sun-burned
face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, what the mischief are you thinking of,
Bob?” he asked quickly. “Stop thinking about football
when you’re the brains, practically, of the team!
Why, only a couple of days ago I heard old Bill saying
that three-quarters of the clever stunts he had made
use of this fall were due to you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister’s face flushed a little and his eyes gleamed
with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Is that straight?” he asked eagerly. “Did he really
say all that?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“He certainly did, and a lot more, which I won’t
repeat for fear you’ll have to buy a bigger-sized hat.
You can’t stop now, Bob, when we’re all counting on
you for so much. The new rules have practically made
a different game out of football, and you’ve been one
of the few that have risen to the occasion and doped
out a bunch of new tricks which will knock spots out
of Harvard. All this warning business is tommyrot.
They won’t drop you, and after the season is over you
can buckle down to work and make up for lost
time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Blake’s words made a deep impression on Hollister,
especially since they coincided exactly with his own
ideas. After all, what was the use in worrying himself
about the matter when there were only a few
more weeks left before the season would be over? He
would have no trouble then in recovering the ground he
had lost, once his mind was freed from the constant
consideration of football problems. And, according
to Jarvis Blake, his help was really needed by the
team.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Better reconsider,” Blake urged presently. “Don’t
give up the ship just yet.”</p>

<p class='c002'>They were going into the laboratory as he spoke,
and Hollister hesitated an instant in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I will, Jarv,” he said slowly. “Much obliged for
all you told me about old Bill. That sort of thing is
mighty encouraging, you know.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A TALK WITH THE DEAN.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Bob Hollister fully expected to find a general warning
awaiting him in his rooms, when he returned at
noon. He had been surprised that it had not appeared
in the morning, but supposed it to have been delayed in
the mail.</p>

<p class='c002'>Consequently, he was not a little dismayed to find,
instead, a typewritten note signed by the dean himself,
asking him kindly to call at the latter’s office at
half-past two.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What in calamity does he mean by that?” he muttered,
crinkling his forehead into a dozen worried
wrinkles. “I reckon I’m in for a good roast this time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Outwardly calm, but with considerable inward trepidation,
he reached the dean’s office five minutes before
the appointed time, and, on sending in his name, was
at once summoned to the inner office.</p>

<p class='c002'>The dean looked up from his desk as the senior entered.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sit down, Mr. Hollister,” he said, indicating a chair
which stood near the desk.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister dropped down in the chair and crossed his
legs. There was silence for a moment while the older
man reached out to take up several papers which had
been pinned together, and glanced them over. Then
he leaned back in his chair and surveyed Bob meditatively
through his gold-rimmed glasses.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You are aware, of course, Mr. Hollister,” he remarked
presently, “that an undergraduate who has
been the recipient of three separate notices warning
him that his rank in as many different studies is not
satisfactory, has sent to him what is called a general
warning?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, sir,” Bob returned quietly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You know, I suppose, the meaning of this general
warning?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, sir—er—well, not exactly,” Bob said hastily.
“I haven’t had one so far myself, but I always thought
that they were a pretty emphatic hint for a fellow to
brace up and attend to business.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The dean’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You have the right notion,” he remarked. “To
deserve a general warning, a man’s record must be
pretty bad. I am sorry to say that yours is more than
bad. It is atrocious.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister’s face flushed and he dropped his eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m sorry,” he murmured.</p>

<p class='c002'>The dean placed the tips of his fingers lightly together
and surveyed the troubled face of the senior
over the tops of them.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It is in such marked contrast to your record of the
past three years,” he went on quietly, “that I decided
to have a talk with you and find out what was the
matter. Can you tell me, Mr. Hollister, why it is
that you seem to have done absolutely nothing in any
class this term?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ve—been thinking—a lot about—football,” stammered
Bob.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Ah! Giving time to it away from the field, you
mean?” the older man inquired.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Is that necessary to a proper performance of the
game?” the dean asked quietly. “I do not seem to
recall any such complaints as these about the work
of other members of the eleven.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He tapped the papers on the desk in front of him
lightly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister glanced up quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It isn’t absolutely necessary,” he answered. “But
the new rules have changed the game a lot and made
it necessary to devise a great many different tricks and
combinations to make up for those which have been
barred out. I’ve been awfully interested in it, and
I’ve spent a good deal of time thinking these things
out, which should, no doubt, have been put to better
use.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The older man nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I understand,” he said slowly. “I have observed
your excellent work on the field, and that is one of the
reasons why I wished to find out what was the matter.
Football, like many other athletic games, is extremely
valuable, Mr. Hollister, as an aid to character development.
But, like almost every other good thing, it is
liable to be done to death. I’m sure you don’t wish to
develop into a man with only one idea, one purpose
in life.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Such a man gets into a rut—becomes narrow, ineffective,
and finally useless. It’s a common failing in
the business world, and has resulted in thousands upon
thousands of the merest machines and human automatons.
While you’re on the field play the game for
all that is in you, but don’t carry the thought of it
always with you, to the exclusion of every other
duty. I shall not send you the general warning just
yet, Mr. Hollister, until I see whether you take this
little talk to heart. Your playing on the eleven has
earned you a little latitude, but it must be understood
that from this moment there has to be a very marked
change for the better in your class records, or I shall
be obliged to let things take their regular course. I
hope you understand my meaning.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Perfectly, sir,” Hollister answered gratefully, “and
I mean to take it to heart as well. I hope that you
won’t have cause for any more complaints.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The dean smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Good,” he said quickly. “If you persist in your
determination, I am sure I shall not. I think that’s
all. No doubt you are eager to get down to the field.
Good afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Good afternoon, sir,” Hollister answered, as he
arose and walked toward the door.</p>

<p class='c002'>Once outside, he dashed out of Lampson Hall, tore
across to the car, and in a few minutes was on his
way to the field.</p>

<p class='c002'>“He certainly is a good sort,” he said to himself as
he got a seat well forward in the car. “I expected to
be handed out a cold calldown, and it was a regular
fatherly talk. He’s right, though, I really ought to
brace up; but how the mischief can I until the season’s
over?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Once on the gridiron, Hollister was in his element.
He flung himself into the practice game with tremendous
enthusiasm, playing with all the vim and go and
energy which he would have exhibited in a hot contest
with another college.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was not the sort that hold back and do just
enough to make a fairly good showing. He must do
his best or nothing, and for that reason he was very
valuable in practice. He always kept his temper, disdained
hard knocks—they were all part of the game;
and he was never too tired to try “just one more formation.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He had worked out his forward pass in detail and
Fullerton approved of it so highly that he tried it out
with complete success that afternoon, much to Hollister’s
delight.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great stunt of yours,” Jarvis Blake said, as they
were trotting across the field toward the athletic house.
“I thought you’d realize that you couldn’t leave off
helping the team out just yet a while.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Again Hollister felt that pleasant, satisfying glow
of ability fitly recognized. Fullerton’s commendations
had been especially emphatic, too, and they had a long
discussion about a new move which the coach had
not been able to plan out in detail, and which he was
anxious to have Bob think over.</p>

<p class='c002'>Even Don Tempest, the captain, usually very chary
with his praise, had held him up as an example to one
or two lagging members of the team; and, altogether,
Hollister was feeling pretty good as he entered the
house.</p>

<p class='c002'>He joined Dick Merriwell, who was hastily dressing
in front of his locker.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Did you get that general warning you were expecting?”
Dick asked.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bob grinned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No; but I got a talking to from the dean,” he returned.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick whistled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Calldown?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not so much of a one as I thought it was going to
be,” Hollister confessed. “Told me I had to brace up
and cut out football off the field. I’d like to have told
him that it was just what you advised last night, but
I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick laughed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Glad to have my judgment confirmed from so eminent
a source,” he smiled. “I hope you’ll take some
of this advice which is being thrown at you so plentifully.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister’s face fell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“After to-night I will,” he said hastily. “I’ve got
to think out that combination of Fullerton’s, you know;
but to-morrow I really will begin to dig good and
hard.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell’s face grew a little serious.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Think that’s wise, Bob?” he asked quietly. “I’ve
noticed that the resolutions which we put off until to-morrow
never materialize. They always get shoved
on to another to-morrow. It’s none of my business,
old fellow, but I should hate like the mischief to have
anything happen so that you couldn’t keep on with the
class.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, they won’t drop me,” Hollister said confidently.
“Even the dean said he’d noticed my work
on the field and thought I ought to have a little latitude.
I’ll make it up after the season’s over, Dick.
I’ll turn into such a grind you won’t know me. Gee!
I’ve got to get a hustle on or I won’t get round to
supper.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He hurried off without giving Dick a chance to reply.
It almost seemed as if he were afraid of what his
friend might say, but there was no fear of Merriwell’s
following him up with advice which was apparently
not wanted.</p>

<p class='c002'>As he glanced after Hollister there was a look of
regret in Dick’s dark eyes. He knew just about how
far Bob would go with his resolutions of turning over
a new leaf, and it worried him a little to think of the
chances his friend was taking.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then, with a shrug of his shoulders, he slipped into
his coat, slapped a cap on his head, and, gathering in
Buckhart, left the house.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>FROM BAD TO WORSE.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>For the next few days, Bob Hollister saw more of
Jarvis Blake than he had in as many weeks before
that. The big, blond fellow took to dropping in at
his rooms at all hours of the day or night, and, though
he usually had some plausible reason for so doing,
it might have been observed that he invariably turned
the talk into the channel of football matters before he
had been there five minutes.</p>

<p class='c002'>This was not difficult to do. More often than not,
he did not have to introduce the matter at all, for
Bob was always ready to meet him even more than
halfway. But the result was that the occasional half-hearted
attempts of Hollister to do a little studying
were completely frustrated.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bob really meant well. He fully intended to take
a brace and follow the advice which had been given
him by Merriwell, and by the dean himself, and had
it not been for these regular visits of Blake, he might
possibly have succeeded in occasionally absorbing a
few facts from his textbooks which would have staved
off for a little while the inevitable smash; for his roommate,
Jim Townsend, though a fellow who took an
absorbing interest in all branches of athletics, had long
ago seen whither his chum was drifting, and had
resolutely refused to discuss anything pertaining to
football with him during the evenings.</p>

<p class='c002'>But Blake had no such compunctions. He seemed to
take a particular delight in running in about eight
o’clock with some idea about the game which had
occurred to him, and about which he wanted Bob’s
opinion. The natural result was that the entire evening
was spent in discussion, and absolutely no studying
was done.</p>

<p class='c002'>As an equally natural consequence, Hollister continued
to make a fearful showing in the classroom,
accumulating zero after zero with a regularity which
was appalling.</p>

<p class='c002'>Townsend tried persuasion at first, urging his friend
to take a brace before it was too late, and pointing
out what the extremely unpleasant result would be if
he did not. Each time Bob would acknowledge in a
good-natured way that he was in the wrong, and vow
that he would turn over a new leaf and do some cramming
that very night.</p>

<p class='c002'>But when the evening came and Blake appeared with
his insidious questions and arguments on football matters,
books would be thrown quickly aside and Hollister
would enter joyfully into the discussion which generally
lasted until bedtime.</p>

<p class='c002'>Once or twice Townsend tackled Blake himself,
showing him clearly how much harm his visits were
doing Hollister; but the big, blond chap laughed down
his arguments, treated the matter as something which
Townsend’s fears had greatly exaggerated, and calmly
went on his way.</p>

<p class='c002'>Very soon Jim began to have a more than sneaking
suspicion that there was some method in Blake’s behavior.
The thing occurred with entirely too much
regularity for it to be merely accidental, especially as
the fellow had not been in the habit of coming into
their rooms more than once or twice a week until
very lately.</p>

<p class='c002'>Gradually this suspicion became a certainty, and,
before very long, Townsend felt sure that he had hit
upon the reason for it all.</p>

<p class='c002'>The thought made his blood boil, and he lost no
time in broaching the matter to his roommate.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bob was rather late coming in from the training
table that night, but the instant he opened the door
Townsend, who had been waiting impatiently for him,
opened fire.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Has it occurred to you, Bob,” he remarked, with
apparent casualness, “that Blake’s been dropping in
here an awful lot lately?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister threw his hat on a chair and plumped himself
down on another.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, I don’t know,” he said carelessly; “perhaps
he has. We’ve had a bunch of things to talk over,
though. He’s really got some very good ideas and
has helped me a lot.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Townsend sniffed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Helped you! Humph!” he exclaimed sarcastically.
“Yes, I believe it!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister glanced inquiringly at him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s the matter, Jim?” he asked. “What you
got against Jarv?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s he come in here every night for, I’d like
to know?” Townsend demanded. “He gets you going
on football, and the result is you haven’t opened a book
since you had that talk with the dean, and your flunks
in the classrooms are something fierce.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister’s face took on an expression of whimsical
annoyance.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thunder, Jim!” he exclaimed petulantly. “What
do you want to start preaching for? You know I’m
going to settle down into a fierce grind the minute the
last game is over. I just can’t find time to do it now
with so much else to think about.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Rot!” growled Townsend. “You talk nutty!
You’d have time enough if that tow-headed son of a
gun didn’t come butting in every night and break you
all up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister made no reply, but his heavy brows drew
down into a scowl. Townsend, too full of his grievance
to notice this, presently continued his argument.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hasn’t it ever occurred to you, Bob,” he said significantly,
“how very nice it would be for Blake if you
were conditioned and had to leave the team? He’s
one of the best subs for your position, and there’s
hardly a question but what he would step into your
shoes at once. I’ll bet that’s the reason which brings
him here so often, with his football talk and his sneers
about there being no danger of the dean doing anything
radical. He’s keeping you from boning on purpose.
He’d be tickled to death to see you dropped so
he could——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Stop!” interrupted Hollister, in an angry voice.
“Just cut out that line of talk, Jim. You forget that
Blake is my friend. You never liked him, I know,
but that’s no reason why you should blackguard him
this way.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His face was dark, and there was an angry flash
in his usually merry brown eyes; for he was a fellow
who was loyal to the very core. Absolutely upright
and honorable himself, it never occurred to him that
there was the most remote possibility that a fellow he
liked as much as he did Jarvis Blake was not entirely
fair and square in every way. The idea to which his
roommate had given voice was incredible. He refused
to tolerate the thought for a single instant, and at once
proceeded to thrust it from his mind with the greatest
expedition.</p>

<p class='c002'>Townsend lapsed into a sullen silence. He had done
his best to warn his chum, but, if Bob was so thick-headed
as all that, he could go his own way without
hindrance.</p>

<p class='c002'>This point of view lasted exactly ten minutes, however.
By that time Jim had cooled down and was
thinking over some other way by which Hollister
could be brought to his senses. Fond as he was of his
roommate, he could not bear the thought of his being
dropped. There must be some way of making him
realize the gravity of the situation.</p>

<p class='c002'>Not for an instant did Townsend waver in his fixed
belief that Blake was deliberately working to bring
about Bob’s downfall so that he could step into his
place on the varsity; and when the blond chap presently
appeared and the usual talk commenced Jim’s
temper soon reached a boiling point. He knew that
if he remained in the room much longer he would have
to blow off steam, and, in the present condition of affairs,
that was not at all to be desired.</p>

<p class='c002'>Consequently, some twenty minutes later, he
slammed down his book, and, without a word of explanation,
picked up his hat and went out.</p>

<p class='c002'>Blake glanced up with a curious smile.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Our friend seems to be somewhat pettish to-night,”
he remarked, in a languid drawl.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister flushed a little. He knew quite well why
Townsend had departed, and it irritated him to think
that his roommate had such a small, narrow nature as
to suspect this big, bluff, frank fellow of any sort of
double dealing.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, I suppose he thought of something he wanted
to do,” he said, rather lamely. “But about that formation
we were speaking of. I’ve doped it all out.
Let me show you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Reaching for a piece of paper, he drew a few swift
lines on it.</p>

<p class='c002'>“See, it’s that way,” he said eagerly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Blake leaned over him, a swift gleam of triumph
in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, that’s the idea,” he returned quietly.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE QUARREL.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>By the time Jim Townsend reached the campus he
was at a white heat.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hang him!” he snapped viciously. “I know that’s
what he’s up to, but how in the mischief can I make
Bob understand? He’s such a softy he simply won’t
believe a thing against Blake, just because he likes
him. The double-faced skunk!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The last remark was intended for Blake, but Jim
was too wrought up to talk coherently. He wandered
around the campus for a few minutes and then decided
to take his troubles to Blair Hildebrand, one of his
particular chums, whose cool, level-headed advice had
helped him out on more than one occasion.</p>

<p class='c002'>He found the big, blue-eyed senior alone, glancing
over the latest issue of the <i>Lit</i>, and evidently very
tired of his own company.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hello, old man,” he said cordially, as Townsend
appeared. “You’re a perfect godsend. George has
gone to New York, and I was just thinking of looking
up some congenial spirit and painting the town red.
How’s everything?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Rotten!” returned Townsend shortly, as he dropped
onto a chair. “That dub, Jarvis Blake, is over at the
rooms jabbering football and keeping Bob from doing
an earthly thing with to-morrow’s work. And you
know how the dean warned him the other day.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hildebrand nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, I heard about it,” he returned. “Isn’t that
something new—Blake’s coming around, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“He’s done it every night this week,” Jim explained
morosely. “I’ll bet any money, Blair, that he’s doing
it on purpose so Bob will be dropped and he’ll get
on the varsity. I told Bob as much to-night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“How did he take it?” Hildebrand asked interestedly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Wouldn’t listen to a word against the man,” returned
Townsend. “Thinks he’s all to the good. You
know Bob never will hear anything against a fellow
he likes.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, he’s a dandy chap that way,” Hildebrand answered
absently. “That’s one of the reasons why
every one likes him so well.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He was evidently thinking about something else.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s all very nice,” Jim retorted quickly; “but
a fellow can carry it too far. He’s making a fool of
himself going on the way he’s been all this term. He’ll
be dropped unless he wakes up mighty sudden. And
I don’t want him dropped. He’s too good a fellow for
that.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Townsend’s voice was mournful and his face downcast
and dejected at the thought of what might happen
to his chum.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently Hildebrand looked up.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I shouldn’t wonder a bit if you were right about
Blake, Jim,” he said. “He makes a mighty good
showing with his frank, hearty manner, but I have
every reason to think that he’s far from being above
just such a trick as this.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Townsend sat up suddenly, his face aglow with interest.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You have?” he exclaimed quickly. “What was it?
Anything which Bob would listen to?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just a little experience I had with him last year,”
the stalwart guard returned quietly; “but it proved
pretty conclusively that Blake was mighty poor stuff.
Whether it would have any effect on Bob or not, is
quite another question.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Can’t you tell a fellow what it was?” Jim asked
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hildebrand shook his head slowly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s the use?” he said, with a quiet smile. “I
don’t believe in knocking a man unless it’s necessary,
even if he isn’t straight. I haven’t told a soul about
this; but if you really think that’s what Blake’s up
to, I have no objection to putting Bob wise on the quiet
some time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m sure it is,” Townsend said decidedly. “He
never used to come around, but ever since Bob got
that talking to from the dean, he’s been in every solitary
night, and insists on jawing football from the
time he sets foot in the room until he leaves. I’ll
take my oath that he’s got a reason for it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“If that’s the case,” Hildebrand returned, “I’ll brace
Bob the first chance I get and tell him a thing or two
which will open his eyes.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The opportunity came the very next afternoon.
Both Hollister and Hildebrand were late getting away
from the field, and it happened that, quite without premeditation
on the part of the latter, they came out of
the gate together. In the bustle and turmoil of practice,
the big guard had quite forgotten his promise to
Townsend, but now it suddenly came back into his
mind.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Say, Bob,” he said slowly, “do you mind walking
for a few minutes? I just remembered something
I wanted to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister looked a little surprised.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, no, not at all,” he returned quickly. “Anything
about the team?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hildebrand hesitated. He had suddenly discovered
that what he had to say was not going to be at all
easy.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Partly, yes,” he answered presently. “I hope you
won’t think I’m a beastly butter-in, Bob, if I touch on
something which is rather personal. I wouldn’t do it
if I didn’t think so much of you and hate to see you
knifed.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister frowned and a puzzled look came into his
eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t see quite what you’re driving at,” he said,
a bit shortly; “but go ahead.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The guard’s pleasant face was flushed. He almost
wished he hadn’t promised Jim; but at length, he drew
a long breath and took the plunge.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s about Blake,” he said quickly. “Jim tells me
he’s been coming in every night and keeping you from
your work. I think you ought to know that he isn’t—well,
he isn’t quite—a fellow to be trusted. I know, because
I caught him cheating in a poker game last
spring—a game for money.”</p>

<p class='c002'>An ominous silence followed. In the light of a
near-by street lamp, Hildebrand saw his companion’s
lithe figure stiffen and his pleasant face harden.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, is that all?” inquired Hollister at length, in
a cold, cutting voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, yes,” Hildebrand answered in surprise. “I
should think it was enough.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister was evidently keeping his temper with an
effort.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Entirely too much!” he snapped. “I hope you’re
pleased with your attempt to blacken the character of
one of my friends. Nice, pleasant occupation, isn’t
it, running down a man when he isn’t around to defend
himself? However, you’ve had your trouble for
your pains. I don’t believe a word of it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hildebrand caught his breath suddenly and his face
turned scarlet. Stopping abruptly, he turned fiercely
on Hollister, with blazing eyes and clenched fists. Another
moment and he would have landed a smashing
blow on the face of the man who had called him a
liar, but, just in time, he got a grip on himself and
realized the utter impossibility of two seniors indulging
in a fist fight in the street.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’ll be sorry for that, Hollister!” he said, in a
voice which quivered with suppressed anger. “I might
have known that this would be all the thanks I’d get
for trying to do you a good turn. I’ll send you written
proof of the statement I just made. Luckily there
were two other men in the game.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without another word, he walked quickly away,
leaving Hollister alone, a feeling of regret that he had
been so hasty, struggling with the anger which Hildebrand’s
accusation against his friend had aroused in
him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I suppose I shouldn’t have said that,” he murmured
regretfully. “But he made me mad with those rotten
insinuations against Jarv.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Then the thought came to him that Hildebrand had
not contented himself with insinuations. He had made
a downright, matter-of-fact statement, which he proposed
to back with written proof. But even then Bob
could not bring himself to believe that Blake would
descend so low as to cheat at cards.</p>

<p class='c002'>There must have been a mistake made somewhere—must
be some explanation of the thing. Blake was
one of his special friends whom he had known and
liked ever since they first entered college together, and
in all that time he had never known Jarvis to do anything
which was not quite square and honorable.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister was not at all a good judge of character.
His likes and dislikes were very strong, but they were
governed by his heart and not by his head. If he once
came to care for a fellow he was ready to stick to
him through thick and thin, stand up for him at all
times and places, and refused to listen to a word
against him. Once or twice during his college life he
had been disappointed in a man who had been admitted
to the inner circle of his friendship. One notable instance
was that of a perfectly charming fellow who
was possessed of almost every known accomplishment
and talent, but in whom the sense of right and wrong
was strangely, inexplicably lacking.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister had taken to him tremendously from the
very first, and the fellow’s charm of manner and personal
magnetism had blinded him to a realizing sense
of his sinister failings. For months Bob stuck to him,
refusing to listen to the advice of other friends who
had discovered the man’s real character, and had only
been brought to his senses by coming in suddenly
one day and catching the fellow in the act of taking
money out of the bill case he had left carelessly on the
table.</p>

<p class='c002'>So he had been all through his college career; honest,
loyal, true-hearted, but strangely blinded by prejudice,
sometimes almost lacking in common sense when
it came to judging the real character of a man.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently a car appeared, but Hollister let it go.
Hildebrand would probably take it, and at the present
moment he did not feel like riding back to the campus
face to face with the man he had just insulted.</p>

<p class='c002'>The more he thought over the matter the sorrier he
was that he had allowed his temper to get the best of
him. He liked Blair, and, now that he had calmed
down, he realized that the big guard must have been
perfectly sincere when he made the charge against
Blake. He had probably done it with the best intentions
in the world.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Though why everybody is so down on Jarv I can’t
imagine,” Bob muttered to himself. “He’s a good fellow,
and we’ve had some dandy talks about football
lately. It’s all rot about his keeping me from work.
I can’t get down to boning, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The next car was a long time coming, and, as he
stood on the curb waiting for it, he remembered his
roommate’s somewhat heated talk of the night before.
But that was perfectly absurd. There could not
be anything in that. Why, Blake had been actually
helping him out with some of the football problems,
giving him some really clever ideas, and he was not
at all likely to do that if he were scheming for his
place on the varsity.</p>

<p class='c002'>“This is worse than trying to study!” he exclaimed
presently, in a tone of exasperation. “I wish people
wouldn’t take such an infernal interest in what I am
doing! Why can’t they let me alone to do as I like?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The answer was simple, though he would never
have guessed it in a thousand years. He was too
decent a fellow to be let alone to ruin himself by his
own blind folly so long as any of his friends could prevent
it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Just then a car came along and Hollister took it.
He did his best to forget his regrettable quarrel with
Hildebrand, but all the way back to the campus it kept
recurring to his mind, bringing with it curious, disturbing
little doubts as to whether there might not be
something after all in the statements the stalwart guard
had made, and which fitted in so patly with Jim Townsend’s
petulant outburst.</p>

<p class='c002'>Consequently, by the time he reached the training
table his condition of mind was not enviable. Hildebrand
was already in his place and seemed to have
recovered completely from his fit of anger; but, though
he was pleasant and genial to the others, he paid no
attention to Bob, ignoring his existence quietly, but
completely.</p>

<p class='c002'>In spite of the fact that he had brought it on himself,
Hollister was hurt by this, and unconsciously his
attitude toward Jarvis Blake underwent a change.</p>

<p class='c002'>As a result of all these wheels within wheels, a sort
of damper was thrown over the whole table which was
felt by every one, though few understood the cause.
They only saw that the jokes fell flat, laughter was
forced, or absent altogether, and the resulting silences
long drawn out.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick Merriwell was quick to see that something unusual
had happened, and long before the meal was over
he was sure that Hollister and Hildebrand had fallen
out in some way. Knowing that there was nothing
worse for the discipline of the team or more productive
of poor work than internal dissensions, he resolved
to find out what the trouble was; and, as they walked
back to the campus through “Grub Alley,” he slipped
his hand through Hollister’s arm.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Say, Bob, what’s the trouble between you and
Blair?” he asked, in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister hesitated.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, we had a run-in this afternoon about Blake,”
he said, in a rather pettish tone. “He told me that
Jarv had been caught cheating at poker, and I as much
as said he was a liar. I reckon I shouldn’t have been
so strong, but he made me mad. He had no business
to say such a thing about a friend of mine.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I see,” Merriwell returned thoughtfully. “Do you
mind telling me what his object was in giving you
that information?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s all come about through Jim!” Hollister burst
out. “He needs to have his head punched. He’s got
the insane idea that Jarv wants to see me dropped so
he can cinch my place in the line. He came out with
that silly story last night. Said Blake comes around
on purpose to keep me from boning so that I’ll flunk
in the classes and be thrown out. Of course, I shut
him up quick, and I suppose he went to Blair with his
fool story.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Blake been coming around much lately?” Dick
asked casually.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Quite a little.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Almost every night, hasn’t he?” Dick persisted.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well—yes,” Hollister acknowledged. “This week,
that is.”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was silence for a few moments, which was
broken by Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m not much on knocking a man, Bob,” he said
quietly; “but if I were you I wouldn’t trust Blake too
far. I know of one or two things he’s done which
weren’t quite——Well, you wouldn’t have done them
yourself, old fellow.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without waiting for a reply, he dropped Bob’s arm
and walked quickly away, leaving Hollister more of
a prey to doubt and suspicions than he had been before.</p>

<p class='c002'>He knew that Merriwell was a man who almost
never said anything against a fellow student. If he
did not like a man, or disapproved of him for any
reason, he had as little to do with him as possible, but
his lips were generally sealed. If he could not say
anything good of a fellow, he preferred keeping silent.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was only on very rare occasions when something
important was at stake that he gave an adverse opinion
of a man, and, consequently, the few words he
had just uttered concerning Blake were especially significant.
They must have some foundation or Merriwell
would never have given voice to them.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister’s mind was in a turmoil. Unwilling to believe
the worst of Blake, it was impossible not to
realize that there must be something underhand about
him or two such fellows as Merriwell and Hildebrand
would never have said what they had against him.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bewildered and sick at heart, Bob made his way
slowly to his rooms. Jim had gone out for the evening,
so that he was alone, and, having tossed hat and
overcoat aside, he dropped down in a chair.</p>

<p class='c002'>At any rate, he did not want to see Blake that night.
With this thing on his mind, he could not feel at ease
with him, and he would rather not see the man until
he had come to some final decision as to what his
course would be. All at once he glanced quickly at
the clock.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By Jove!” he exclaimed, springing up. “He’s likely
to be here any time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Snatching up his coat and hat, he was about to
hurry out when he heard the muffled slam of the big
entrance door below.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll bet that’s him now,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c002'>The next moment he had switched off the light and
hurried into the bedroom, where he softly drew the
door partly shut and stood behind it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently a step sounded in the hall, followed by a
knock at the door. Then the latch clicked and some
one entered the room.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hello, Bobby,” called a familiar voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was no response. Presently Blake stepped
over to the electric light and switched it on.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not here,” he murmured, his eyes traveling swiftly
about the room. “That’s funny. He was ahead of me
crossing the campus.”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a pause during which the big, blond fellow
whistled softly, as he walked up and down the
room.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s the good of waiting?” he muttered at
length. “He may not come in for an hour or two.
His hash is as good as settled, anyhow. After the exhibition
he made of himself to-day, the dean can’t help
doing something. Maybe little Jarvie will play in the
Harvard game after all.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He laughed softly; there was a click and the room
was shrouded in darkness; the door closed and silence
fell.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE CRASH.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>In the bedroom Bob Hollister stood silent, a rush of
bitter anger and regret overwhelming him. Merriwell
and Hildebrand and old Jim had all been right. What
a blind fool he had been not to have seen through Blake
before! What a perfect idiot they must think him!</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently he came back into the sitting room, and,
turning on the light, stood hesitating in the middle of
the room. It was up to him to get busy and do something
pretty quick. He must not let Blake triumph.</p>

<p class='c002'>The sudden shock had made him realize his precarious
position more clearly than a dozen arguments
would have done, and there was now an added incentive
to work. He was determined that Blake should
not accomplish the purpose for which he had schemed.
His blood was aroused to a boiling point. He would
not be dropped!</p>

<p class='c002'>But, first of all, he must see Blair. He had behaved
shamefully that afternoon to the fellow who had done
a distasteful thing purely for his own good, and Bob
felt that he could not rest until he had apologized.</p>

<p class='c002'>Slipping into his coat, he hurried out of Vanderbilt
and made his way swiftly across to Lawrence. It
must be confessed that his heart rather failed him as
he mounted the stairs and stood before Hildebrand’s
door, but without hesitation he raised his hand and
knocked.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come in,” called a voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister opened the door and stood hesitating on
the threshold.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hildebrand sat alone by the table, and, as he glanced
up and saw who his caller was, his face darkened.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well?” he said curtly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister flushed and took a step forward.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I—I’ve been—a fool, Blair,” he stammered. “I
beg your pardon for what I said this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, you’ve found that out, have you?” Hildebrand
inquired sarcastically.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was still sore over the result of his attempt that
afternoon to open Hollister’s eyes as to the real character
of Blake. It had not been a pleasant nor an
easy thing to do, and Bob’s reception of it had cut
him to the quick, besides making him furiously angry.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes; he’s all you said of him and more,” Hollister
returned in a low tone. “I just found out, and I
couldn’t rest until I had told you how sorry I am about
the way I talked to you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His manner was so dejected, and the look of penitence
in his eyes was so very real as he turned toward
the door again, that Hildebrand could not help but
relent.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come back here, you old idiot!” he exclaimed,
springing to his feet. “You certainly did made me
hot this afternoon, but what’s the use of keeping mad?
Give us your fist, and the next time don’t be so infernally
set in your way.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister’s eyes brightened as he gripped the proffered
hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re all to the good, Blair,” he said quickly.
“Most fellows would have felt like kicking me downstairs.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I felt worse than that this afternoon,” the big
guard grinned. “But nobody can stay mad with you
very long, Bobby. Sit down and let’s hear about it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister told the story briefly, and then, in spite of
his friend’s urging, he departed to put in the rest of the
evening in hard studying. Since it was the first time
he had really applied himself to his books in weeks, he
naturally did not make much progress, but at least it
was a beginning.</p>

<p class='c002'>The blow came the next morning, when the first
mail brought him a letter from the dean’s office. He
opened it with trembling fingers and glanced through
the brief contents. The typewritten communication
was short, terse, very much to the point, and bore the
scrawly signature of the dean himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Sir</span>: Since you have seen fit utterly to disregard
my advice of a week ago, I am forced to tell
you that unless you attain a grade of at least sixty
in every recitation from now until the beginning of
the winter vacation your name will be dropped from
the rolls of the senior class.”</p>

<p class='c012'>In perfect silence, jaws set and face a little pale,
Hollister read the short note through the second time.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Holy cats!” he muttered. “That’s the end of yours
truly, all right! Sixty per cent.! Why don’t he say a
hundred and be done with it? I stand about as much
show of getting it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Now that it was too late, he saw with vivid clearness
the extent of his amazing folly. Merriwell had
done his utmost to make him realize the seriousness
of his position a week ago. Jim had been trying his
best to help him for a longer time than that. Even
the dean had strained a point of college discipline in
his favor. And in spite of all this he had gone his
way blithely and blindly, living only in the present,
with a perfectly suicidal disregard for the future.</p>

<p class='c002'>What could he do? What was there possible for
him to do? He was in despair. He had no more than
a glimmering of the work for that day. It would need
nothing less than a miracle for him to get the required
percentage.</p>

<p class='c002'>The more he thought over the matter, the more
despondent he became. At length, as a last resort, he
resolved to go to Dick with his troubles. He did not
hope for any happy solution of the difficulty, but there
is always a little comfort in talking over one’s miseries
with somebody; and Bob knew that Dick would
never say, “I told you so.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Happily, the first recitation was scheduled for eleven
o’clock, and Hollister found Dick alone in his rooms
working over some math problems. He looked up
smiling as the dismayed fellow entered.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hello, Bobby,” he greeted. “What’s the matter?
You look as if life held no further joys for you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without a word, Hollister thrust the dean’s letter
into Merriwell’s hand. Dick read it through with
knitted brows, and, having finished, folded it methodically
and handed it back.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Wouldn’t that kill you dead!” he exclaimed. “Sixty
per cent.! Let’s see how we can dope that out.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister looked at him blankly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Dope it out!” he exclaimed. “What is there to
dope out? I’m done!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Rot!” Dick returned emphatically. “You’re not
going to give up without an effort, are you? We’ll
get you through somehow. But you’ll have to buckle
down and work like a terror.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll work, all right,” Hollister returned, in a dispirited
voice; “but I can’t make that average. Why,
I’ve got to start in and make it this very day, man, and
I haven’t the haziest notion of what the Latin lesson
is, though I did grind some on chemistry last night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Never know what you can do till you try, Bobby,”
Dick said cheerily. “Why, we can’t let you be dropped,
old fellow. Rather than that, I’ll turn tutor and drag
you through by the hair of your head.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He paused and his face grew serious.</p>

<p class='c002'>“There’s one thing sure, though,” he went on, his
eyes fixed on Hollister’s face; “you’ll have to give up
football, and drop it like a hot cake this very day.”</p>

<p class='c002'>For an instant Hollister looked at him blankly as if
he did not comprehend what the other had said. Then
he understood, and a look of utter despair came into
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Give it up!” he cried. “Oh, Dick, I can’t!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’ve got to,” Merriwell retorted firmly. “Can’t
you see that if you don’t you’ll be dropped sure as fate?
You can’t play football and study at the same time.
You’re not made that way. It’s a question of giving
it up voluntarily or of being dropped from the class
and, consequently, from the varsity.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister groaned. How could he give up the thing
he loved better than anything else in the world! What
would college life be without it? He almost felt as
if he’d rather be dropped than voluntarily give it up,
except that such a course would mean the same thing
in the end.</p>

<p class='c002'>He looked at Merriwell pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“But I could still play in the games, even if I didn’t
show up for practice, couldn’t I?” he urged.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick shook his head.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You couldn’t,” he said decidedly. “You’ve got to
the point when you have to give every atom of your
mind to your work. The minute you begin to think
about playing in a game your attention will be distracted.
You won’t be able to study. It can’t be done,
Bob. You don’t suppose I’m anxious to see you leave
the team, do you? Great Scott, man! I don’t know
what we’ll do without you. But it’s your only chance.
Don’t you see that?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister saw it only too clearly. He realized perfectly
the truth of Merriwell’s words. He knew quite
well that if he were going to play in a game he would
be thinking for days beforehand about it. Unconsciously
his mind would wander and he would cease
giving the proper attention to his books. Bitterly he
regretted the moment when he first began to let things
slide. If he had only not let his enthusiasm for the
game get the better of him he would be all right
now.</p>

<p class='c002'>And suddenly into his mind came the thought of
Jarvis Blake and his treachery. The fellow would triumph
now and would very likely get his place on the
varsity. He could not bear the idea.</p>

<p class='c002'>“If I quit the team Blake will be put on,” he said
aloud. “I couldn’t stand that, Dick. It’s what he’s
been after right along. Last night—I heard——”</p>

<p class='c002'>A gleam of combat came into Merriwell’s eyes and
his chin squared.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I thought so,” he said emphatically. “I had a notion
that was his game. But it won’t work if I can
put a spoke in his wheel. There are a couple of other
subs who are as good as he is. I rather think one
of them will take your place.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“If you could only work it, Dick!” Hollister said
eagerly. “Of course, I’m not trying to blame him for
what’s happened. That’s all up to me. But I do know
that he did his best to have me dropped, and if he
got my place in the line I couldn’t stand it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Don’t worry,” Merriwell said quickly. “I don’t
think he will.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He paused and looked Hollister keenly in the eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well,” he said slowly, “have you made up your
mind?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Still Bob wavered, unwilling to take the step which,
deep down in his heart, he knew would have to come.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell showed no signs of impatience. With
rare sympathy, he realized what a struggle must be
going on in the man’s mind. The thought of all it
would mean to him if, for any reason, <i>he</i> were forced
to give up football was appalling, and he knew that
Hollister was even more devoted to the game.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I know how hard it is, Bobby,” he said quietly.
“But after a little you’ll come to see that it’s the only
thing for you to do. Football—any game, in fact—is
a splendid thing when it keeps its proper proportions
as something incidental to the college course. But the
minute it begins to dominate a man, as it has done you
to the exclusion of everything else, it’s time to cut
it out. You didn’t come to Yale to play football, but
to get your degree and the other benefits which a college
course gives a man. Think how you’d feel if you
were dropped at the very beginning of your senior
year. Think of the humiliation of being thrown out
with such a record as you have made this fall.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I can’t even play in the Yale-Princeton game on
Saturday?” Hollister questioned sadly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick shook his head firmly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, sir,” he returned with emphasis. “You give
me your promise never to play football again while
you’re in college, and I’ll do my very best to pull you
through in your studies. How about it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“All right,” Hollister said, in a low voice. “I promise.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Good,” Dick smiled. “That’s the stuff. Now let’s
get down to business.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He glanced swiftly at the clock.</p>

<p class='c002'>“An hour and a half before Latin,” he murmured.
“We’ve got to get busy.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Before Hollister knew what he was doing, Dick had
him sitting at the table, the open book before him,
and together they proceeded to go through the day’s
allotment of Horace.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell did his work thoroughly, translating
slowly and stopping to explain the derivation of every
word about which Bob had the least doubt. He had a
natural gift of making things plain, and in an hour’s
time Hollister had acquired a pretty good notion of
what it was all about. Then, after a hurried review
of the chemistry lesson, they sallied forth to the lecture
room.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I think you’ll do in the Horace, old fellow,” Dick
assured him. “Just keep your head and take it slowly,
and you’ll come out all right.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Such proved to be the case. About halfway through
the hour, Professor Goodhue called Hollister’s name
in a rather weary tone of voice, fully expecting a repetition
of the absolute failures for which the fellow had
become noted.</p>

<p class='c002'>To his amazement, Hollister arose slowly and gave
a very good rendering of the passage, even to construing
accurately the few words the dazed professor
asked him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That will do, Mr. Hollister,” the latter managed to
say when Bob had finished. “Very good indeed. I
should—er—like to congratulate you on the extraordinary
improvement in your work.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thank you, sir,” Bob murmured, his face a bit
red.</p>

<p class='c002'>On the campus outside, Dick slapped him on the
back.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well done!” he exclaimed. “That was more than
sixty, all right. You’ll do. Now for the lab. That’s
going to be harder, for we didn’t give any time to it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>As they mounted the steps to the chemical laboratory,
Bob happened to catch a glimpse of Blake’s face,
and the look of ill-tempered annoyance he saw there
was an added incentive to renewed endeavor. The big,
blond fellow was evidently not at all pleased with the
surprising turn things had taken.</p>

<p class='c002'>By some fortunate chance, Hollister was not called
upon at all in chemistry. Perhaps the professor had
grown weary of his constant failures and did not think
it worth while. At all events, it gave Bob a little
respite. There were no other recitations that day,
and by to-morrow, he hoped, with Dick’s assistance,
to have made up a little of the lost time.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell realized perfectly that what he had undertaken
was not going to be any easy task. There was
no fun at all in coaching a fellow who had done absolutely
no work for almost six weeks, and was, consequently,
totally ignorant of what had been gone
over so far that term. But this fact did not deter him
in the least. He knew that it was the only way by
which Hollister could be saved, and, though it meant
that every spare moment must be devoted to tutoring
Bob for a few weeks at least, he was fond enough of
the fellow to go to that extreme.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister’s announcement at the training table that
he had to leave the team was one of the hardest things
he had ever done. It had the effect of a bombshell on
the assembled players.</p>

<p class='c002'>Instantly the room was in an uproar. The fellows
all crowded around him, unable to believe their ears.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You can’t leave, Bobby!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Cut it out, old man, and have another think.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Stop your kidding!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thunderation! What’ll we do without you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>These and a dozen other incredulous exclamations
were hurled at the wretched fellow, but Bob persisted
in his resolve; and when the men saw that he was really
in earnest, they were in despair.</p>

<p class='c002'>All, that is, save Jarvis Blake. Dick, his eye on the
fellow, noticed the sudden expression of amazed incredulity
which flashed into his face, to be followed
instantly by a look of joy and unmistakable triumph.
Evidently he had not expected this turn of affairs, but
he was none the less more than satisfied with it.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll put a spoke in your wheel, my bucko,” Dick
muttered fiercely. “All your dirty scheming won’t do
you a bit of good.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He put in an hour’s work with Hollister after dinner,
and, laying out enough to keep the man busy that
afternoon, he got out the car and drove down to the
field.</p>

<p class='c002'>His first move was to seek out Tempest and Bill Fullerton,
and for ten minutes the three men remained in
close confab. When they separated there was a look
of extreme satisfaction on Dick’s face. He hurried
into the athletic house to get into his togs.</p>

<p class='c002'>A little later, when the men were all assembled on
the field, Don Tempest held up his hand for silence.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You fellows all know that Hollister has been
obliged to leave the team,” he said quietly. “You
also know why. It’s something which can’t be helped,
but I’m sure you will agree with me that it hits us
pretty hard and will make a big hole in the line. I’m
sorry it couldn’t have been postponed until after the
game on Saturday, but since that was impossible we’ll
just have to make the best of it. In regard to filling
his place——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He hesitated and his eyes wandered over the eager,
expectant faces of the subs. Many of them knew that
there was no possible chance of their being picked for
the important position, but there were three or four
who evidently had hopes.</p>

<p class='c002'>Jarvis Blake had more than hopes, if one could judge
from the look of assurance on his face. There was
plainly small doubt in his mind that he would be the
lucky man, and Dick watched him with a distinct feeling
of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c002'>“In talking it over,” Tempest continued, “we have
decided that Keran had better try out for end until
further notice.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Blake gave a gasp of dismay. The blow was so sudden
and so absolutely unexpected that, for an instant,
he could not believe his ears.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then his face turned scarlet, his eyes flashed, and he
took a quick step forward. Dick was watching him
quietly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I think——” began the big, blond fellow, speaking
with evident difficulty.</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest eyed him coldly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I said Keran,” he remarked significantly; “Phil
Keran.”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was an undercurrent of contempt in his voice
which cut Blake like the lash of a whip and made him
step back involuntarily. Before he could recover his
customary poise, the fellows spread out in the regular
formation, Keran, grinning from ear to ear, in the
coveted place at right end.</p>

<p class='c002'>Blake had never been so furious in his life. He
could not understand how it had all come about. For
a moment he was tempted to leave the field. He had
even turned and was about to stride off without a
word, when he realized that such a move would be
folly. He would gain nothing by it, and his chances
for ever accomplishing his end would be totally ruined.</p>

<p class='c002'>With a sullen scowl on his face, he walked over to
his place on the scrub. After all, Keran was only in
the varsity on sufferance. He might not make good,
and then Blake’s chance would come.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It must not be supposed that Bob Hollister’s course
was an easy one. It was, on the contrary, desperately
hard. A dozen times a day bitter thoughts and regrets
for what he had given up assailed him, but he
managed to thrust these aside, and, with Dick’s help,
he kept doggedly at his work, encouraged by the very
evident progress he made in his studies.</p>

<p class='c002'>The story of his renunciation of football and his
steady application to his books seemed to have become
known to the faculty. Certain it was that, one and
all, they realized what an effort he was making to
stick with the class, and most of them did their best
to help him along.</p>

<p class='c002'>As for Merriwell, every minute he could spare was
devoted to coaching Bob. The latter almost lived in
Dick’s rooms. Every evening they went over the work
for the next day together, Dick patiently explaining
every point, bolstering up Hollister’s failing courage,
making a regular hermit of himself for the sake of the
other man’s future.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the afternoons Bob spent his time grinding on the
back work, for occasionally the professors had an
annoying way of having little quizzes which covered
the subjects they had gone over that term.</p>

<p class='c002'>That was the hardest part of it all, to sit alone with
a book before him, knowing all the time that the others
were out on the field where he longed to be more than
anywhere else in the world. At first he had to grit
his teeth and exercise the utmost self-control to keep
his mind from wandering; but, after a little, it came
easier, though he was never wholly resigned.</p>

<p class='c002'>At last came the day of the Yale-Princeton game.
Hollister wondered desperately whether he would have
to stay away from the field that afternoon. It seemed
as if that would be more than he could bear. In the
morning he broached the subject to Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“About the game this afternoon, Dick,” he began
hesitatingly. “It don’t seem as if I could study while
that’s going on. Couldn’t I go down and watch it,
just this once?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Do you think that’s a good idea, Bobby?” he asked
slowly. “Wouldn’t you feel worse on the field, not
being able to play, than you would if you stayed
away?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Gee, no!” exclaimed Hollister. “Even if I don’t
play, there’d be some satisfaction watching it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come on, then,” Merriwell said quickly. “You’ve
certainly done well enough to take the afternoon off.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Thus it was that Hollister sat in the tonneau of
Dick’s car as the <i>Wizard</i> tore down to the field that
afternoon. Tempest and Blair Hildebrand sat with
him, Rudolph Rose crumpled his long legs in the body
of the car at their feet, while Teddy Baxter clung
precariously to the running board.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister felt a thrill of the old joyful enthusiasm
as the car whirled through the streets. Once more he
seemed to be one of them, and, as he entered the
grounds and swept his eye over the already filling
stands, he sniffed the air like a war horse that scents
combat from afar.</p>

<p class='c002'>But once in the dressing room, the reaction came.
He saw the others strip and hurriedly don their togs;
listened to their eager, excited discussion of their
chances for victory; watched them troop out in a body
and lope across to the gridiron; and, as he followed
slowly, dispiritedly, he realized with a bitter pang that
he was out of it. Instead of plunging into the contest
with tingling blood and every sense alert, doing his
best for his Alma Mater, straining every nerve to win
a victory for the blue, he must stand on the side lines
and just watch.</p>

<p class='c002'>The thrilling, deep-toned cheers of the excited thousands
would ring in his ears as before, but they would
have a different sound. They would be meant for
others, not for him. Somehow, he felt that if he could
only have played in this one game he could be resigned
about never going on the field again. If he
could only show just once more what he could do—play
just one more game for all that was in him, and
perhaps help to win a victory, it would content him.</p>

<p class='c002'>But it was too late. He had given his word, and
the team was finally made up. With downcast eyes
and bitter heart, he entered the inclosure and, walking
past the grand stands, dropped down on the side
lines with the subs. At least he would watch the game
from the field. He couldn’t bear sitting in a stand.
He had never done that in all the time he had first come
out for the team.</p>

<p class='c002'>The stands were filled to overflowing, a sea of eager,
enthusiastic faces rising, tier upon tier, from the field.
Flags fluttered by the hundreds, blue, mostly, but with
a liberal sprinkling of the orange and black. The hum
of many voices sounded like the drone of a gigantic
hive of bees. The flash of many faces turned impatiently
toward the closed gates as the hour approached.</p>

<p class='c002'>At last the gates were flung open and the teams appeared.
Princeton came first, and cantered briskly
across the field. They were greeted by a round of applause
from their adherents.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then Yale appeared, and the stands rose to them
with a yell which sent a thrill through Hollister’s heart—a
thrill followed swiftly by a stab of pain. Perhaps
Dick had been right when he said it would be
harder here than if he had stayed away.</p>

<p class='c002'>Yale won the toss, and, there being a rather brisk
wind blowing, chose the protected goal and gave the
enemy the ball. The fellows swiftly took their places
to await the kick off. Presently the whistle sounded,
and from that moment Bob Hollister was oblivious to
time and space, the shouting crowd, the excited subs—everything,
in short, except the progress of the contest
before him.</p>

<p class='c002'>Almost at once he saw that Princeton had an unusually
strong team. He had expected something of
the sort, for all reports agreed in stating that it was
the best eleven the New Jersey college had turned
out in several years; but Hollister had not thought it
would be quite so good as it now appeared.</p>

<p class='c002'>With knitted brows, he watched the progress of the
ball down the field toward Yale’s goal. There was
no doubt in his mind that the orange-and-black fellows
had made the most of some very efficient coaching.
Their teamwork was splendid, and every now and
then they made use of some novel play which caused
Hollister to bestow upon them a sincere, if somewhat
grudging, admiration.</p>

<p class='c002'>But presently he ceased to watch their good points
and bent an anxious, scrutinizing eye upon his former
comrades. Something seemed to be the matter with
their playing. A subtle, impalpable something, hard
to define, but plainly evident to the quick mind of the
man on the side line.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a slight absence of snap, of unity, which
perhaps another might not have seen. Hollister was
entirely too modest to realize that his absence from
the team could make any difference. He did not see
that the lack of his swift, perfect brainwork, his cheering
encouragement, would be felt to any appreciable
extent. And yet, that was actually the case.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell was playing a perfect game, Buckhart
was at his best; but they could not carry the whole
team. Don Tempest, still not perfectly strong after
his long illness, and feeling the lack of the practice
which he had lost, did not make a very good showing.
While Phil Keran, though he was a good steady player
and did his best, could never take the place of Hollister,
one of the best ends Yale had ever had.</p>

<p class='c002'>Slowly the ball was forced back. Nearer and nearer
it came to the goal. Bob’s heart leaped into his throat
and he could not swallow. They must not make a goal—they
must not!</p>

<p class='c002'>Then the line stiffened, the advance ceased. Two
downs brought barely five yards gain. Not daring to
risk another forward pass, Princeton tried a kick from
the field.</p>

<p class='c002'>The ball soared over the heads of the scrimage line.
To Hollister, tense, breathless, it seemed as if it would
pass over the bar, and he groaned aloud as the orange-and-black
line surged forward in its wake.</p>

<p class='c002'>The groan changed to a gasp of joy as the pigskin
carromed from an upright and a tall, lithe figure leaped
into the air, clutched it and dropped back.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was Merriwell. Bob could have shouted aloud
in his relief had he not been too intent on watching
the outcome. For an instant the men were so involved
in a tangle of flying figures and waving arms that he
could not see what had become of the ball.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then, all at once, a man darted around the end,
closely followed by two others, and sped over the
ground in an oblique course toward the farther side
line.</p>

<p class='c002'>In an instant Bob recognized him as Crowfoot, and
realized that Dick had in some way passed the ball
swiftly to the Indian, who, assisted by Elwell and
Kenny, the quarter back, was covering the ground like
a streak of light.</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny was bowled over instantly; Elwell met his
Waterloo a minute afterward; but by the time Crowfoot
was tackled by one of the Princeton guards he
had covered thirty yards and the ball was back out of
danger.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then the whistle sounded and Hollister realized that
the first quarter was over.</p>

<p class='c002'>After the brief three-minute interval, Yale started
in with a rush, carrying the ball down the field in a
series of brilliant plays which did full credit to every
man on the team.</p>

<p class='c002'>They seemed to have recovered from their strange
lassitude and were evidently determined to utterly annihilate
their opponents.</p>

<p class='c002'>But that was not to be done easily. Oddly enough,
Princeton blandly refused to be annihilated. And so
the hard-fought battle continued. Back and forth
surged the lines of tattered, gasping, breathless men.
At one moment it would seem that Yale had the advantage,
and apparently nothing could prevent her
from scoring. Then Princeton would rally and force
the blue line slowly, but surely, back from the danger
zone.</p>

<p class='c002'>To the man on the side line it was sheer agony. His
trained eye saw the weak points of his team even more
swiftly than did Tempest, the captain. His alert brain,
feverishly active, took in lost opportunities which the
men on the field did not even perceive, and he was constantly
thinking of how he would have made a successful
play if he had only been out there with the rest.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then began a series of minor accidents which played
havoc with the Yale line. First of all, Rose was
knocked senseless and had to leave the field. Then
Samp Elwell twisted his ankle so that he could not
stand on it; and another sub threw off his enveloping
blanket, jerked off his sweater, and raced into the
arena in response to Tempest’s peremptory gesture.</p>

<p class='c002'>Last of all, Phil Keran gave out, and, after a momentary
hesitation, Tempest reluctantly summoned
Jarvis Blake from the side line. He was the best man
left, and, perhaps, had it not been for what he had
heard from Dick about the fellow, Tempest might have
put him in before; for Blake had always showed up
well in practice.</p>

<p class='c002'>As Hollister saw his enemy race out and take his
own place at right end, he clenched his fists so tightly
that the nails cut into the flesh of his palm. This was
the worst of all. Blake was now just where he had
been scheming to get.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then the teams lined up and Bob forgot even that.
It became apparent at once that the change had not
been for the better. Princeton had been obliged to put
in only one substitute, and her advantage showed very
plainly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Strive as the Yale line did against them, the solid
phalanx of the opposing team made its way inexorably
down the field. There were occasional rallies, to be
sure, but never once did the orange and black fail to
make their required gain; and at last, with a sob in
his throat, Hollister saw the pigskin forced over the
line and heard the Princeton crowd thundering its
joy.</p>

<p class='c002'>The goal was kicked, and, before the second quarter
was over, Princeton had scored again on a drop kick,
and was nine points to the good.</p>

<p class='c002'>Things looked very black for Yale.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister did not leave his place on the grass. He
could not bring himself to go back to the house with
the team. He had not the heart. And so he lay there
viciously jabbing the blade of his knife into the ground,
his brow drawn into a scowl, his brown eyes full of a
strange mixture of longing and pain.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had been watching Blake’s playing, and it had
taken him only a few moments to see how much it
fell short of his own. Hollister was not in the least
conceited, but he had a keen sense of sizing a fellow
up on the field and had always viewed his own good
points and shortcomings as dispassionately as he did
those of any one else.</p>

<p class='c002'>Watching Jarvis Blake, he knew that he himself
could have done better. Blake was a good player, but
he was deficient in some important qualifications, principally
initiative and speed in starting.</p>

<p class='c002'>Time and time again, Bob saw him fail to take advantage
of an opportunity which might have meant a
gain of yards to his team. Once, in his excitement,
he had shouted a warning to the substitute, only to
realize what he was doing and choke himself into silence.</p>

<p class='c002'>The third quarter started off with a fresh swing.
The rest had done all the men good, and evidently there
had been some straight talk in the athletic house which
heartened them and brought them to a realizing sense
of the gravity of their position.</p>

<p class='c002'>The ball was forced down to within the thirty-yard
line without a pause. Hollister, watching eagerly, soon
saw whose brain was dominating the work. Almost
every time the pigskin was passed to Merriwell. And,
with quite as much regularity, the brilliant senior responded
nobly.</p>

<p class='c002'>He seemed to be everywhere at once, slippery as an
eel, dodging hither and thither in a most bewildering
fashion, sometimes passing the ball to Crowfoot, or
another on whom he could depend, but always making
gains, ever advancing, until Bob found himself sitting
erect, his cheeks burning and his eyes sparkling as he
watched this amazing exhibition of almost perfect football.</p>

<p class='c002'>Would he make it? Could he possibly hold out to
reach the line? Suddenly his question was answered.</p>

<p class='c002'>The quarter back ripped out a rapid signal which Bob
could not hear perfectly; the ball was snapped back;
there was a bewildering, lightninglike, intricate pass.
Hollister gasped. It was his improved crisscross play,
the last thing he had worked out before he had left the
team.</p>

<p class='c002'>The pigskin seemed to leap from one man to another
like a thing endowed with life. For a minute he lost
track of it, and then he caught his breath swiftly as
Merriwell sprang out of the mêlée, the pigskin tucked
under his arm, and raced over the turf as if he were as
fresh as the moment he had first set foot on the field.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Princeton crowd was taken by surprise. The
pass had been so cleverly made that most of them
thought the ball was being sent around the other end,
and there was a surging rush in that direction, which
left a comparatively free field for Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>Too late they saw their error and trailed after him.</p>

<p class='c002'>There were but two men between him and the coveted
goal. He could easily outdistance the first, who
was a little to one side, but the full back would have
to be dodged.</p>

<p class='c002'>As he ran, he watched the man keenly, wondering
just what trick he would have to bring into play to
get away from him. The fellow stood alertly on his
toes, watching, waiting, ready to spring to one side
or the other, as the case might be.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick came on without slackening his speed, swerved
suddenly to the right, whirled, darted the other way,
and all in such a brief moment that to this day Princeton’s
full back hasn’t the least notion of how he was
fooled. He only knew that by the time he had turned
Dick was a dozen feet away, speeding on toward the
goal.</p>

<p class='c002'>The next instant the full back gave a grunt of triumph
and stretched himself, for the Yale man suddenly
staggered, tried wildly to recover, and then fell
full length to the sod.</p>

<p class='c002'>A groan of horror went up from the stands, followed
by deathlike stillness.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then, to the amazement of the onlookers, they saw
that, instead of lying where he had fallen, Merriwell
spun end over end, and the next instant he was on
his feet again. But he ran with an appreciable limp.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was a tense moment. The full back was gaining.
Slowly, but surely, he crept up and the distance between
the two lessened. Dick ran with more and
more apparent effort, and it was plain to all that he
must be suffering tortures.</p>

<p class='c002'>Now the full back’s fingers touched him, but could
find no hold on the smooth canvas. The next instant
they clutched his waist, and clung there with a firm,
dragging grip.</p>

<p class='c002'>Five yards more! Could he ever make it?</p>

<p class='c002'>Struggling, dragging, straining every nerve and
muscle, Merriwell flung himself over the line; and,
as he did so, a great sigh arose from the spectators,
merging into a crashing burst of sound, for they realized
that the ball was over.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A BROKEN PROMISE AND A VICTORY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Despite his sprained ankle, Merriwell kicked the
goal, straight and true, and the teams lined up again.
But that run had been a last desperate attempt to
wrest victory from defeat.</p>

<p class='c002'>Unable to count longer on Dick, who, though he was
still able to play, could not be expected to continue
the extraordinary efforts which had made him an
object of wonder to every man on the field, the team
went to pieces as nearly as any Yale team can.</p>

<p class='c002'>They played despairingly, doggedly, disputing every
inch on the part of the Princeton organization, but for
all that being borne slowly down the field.</p>

<p class='c002'>The ginger was gone out of them. They had no
life, and their playing had become more or less machinelike.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bob Hollister realized this swiftly. He knew the
signs only too well.</p>

<p class='c002'>“They can’t do it!” he almost sobbed. “They can’t
beat them that way!”</p>

<p class='c002'>If he could only go into the game. Just for that
last quarter. Surely it could not do any harm. He
must do it. He could not sit there and see the fellows
beaten.</p>

<p class='c002'>The third quarter was nearly over when he leaped
to his feet, his face white and determined, and ran
swiftly toward the house. Dashing inside, he encountered
Keran, his face a network of scowling
lines, his fists clenched, and one foot tied up in
bandages.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Gimme your clothes!” Hollister exclaimed.
“Quick!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What——” gasped Keran.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Blazes!” ripped out the excited fellow. “Your
clothes, I tell you! Get ’em off! Mine aren’t here!”</p>

<p class='c002'>With an exclamation of joy, the other realized
what he meant to do. Snatching off his jacket and
jersey, he tossed them to Bob, who was already half
undressed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Glory be!” he cried. “You’re going to play! You’ll
brace ’em up!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister made no answer. His eyes were gleaming.
One thought only was in his mind. He must
get into those togs and back to the field before the
beginning of the last quarter. He meant to play if
he never did another thing in all his life. His promise
to Merriwell was forgotten. He thought of nothing
but that line of gasping, tattered men out there, striving
vainly against black defeat.</p>

<p class='c002'>With eager, trembling fingers, Keran helped him lace
his jacket. Rudolph Rose staggered up from where
he lay full length on a bench, and, dropping down on
the floor, laced up his shoes. Neither of them spoke
a word, for words were unnecessary. They understood.</p>

<p class='c002'>In a miraculously short time Bob was ready, and,
snatching up a nose guard, he tore out of the house.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bill Fullerton, his face black as a thundercloud, was
talking to Tempest on the side lines. The brief intermission
was almost over as Bob dashed up to them.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I want to go in, Don!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c002'>Both men looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I thought——” Tempest began.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Never mind that,” Hollister interrupted. “I’ve got
to go in! That’s the only way. The fellows have
gone all to pieces since Merriwell hurt himself!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Still the captain of the varsity hesitated. He knew
quite well of the promise Hollister had made Merriwell
that he would not play football again during his
college course.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I swear to you, Don, by all that’s holy,” Bob said
earnestly, “that if you let me play out this game I’ll
never touch football again! It’s only fifteen minutes,
Don! Just fifteen little minutes! If I sit here watching
it, I shall go mad. Let me play, Don.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His pleading voice quivered with the emotion which
was tearing him.</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest was in somewhat of a quandary. He
wanted to put Hollister in, for he felt that it was
barely possible that Bob might succeed in putting spirit
into the jaded, discouraged men. He was fresh, too,
and wrought up to a white heat of enthusiasm. It
would be strange if he did not accomplish something.
Don glanced at Fullerton questioningly.</p>

<p class='c002'>The coach nodded emphatically.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s the only thing that can possible save the day,”
he said decidedly. “Better let him in.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Who——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Blake, of course!” Fullerton said tersely. “He’s
rotten!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister’s face lit up joyfully as he listened to this
brief conversation. Then the signal came, and there
was a general movement to get out on the field.</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest walked rapidly to Blake’s side and said a
few words to him in a low tone. The big, blond fellow
flushed scarlet and darted a venomous glance at
Bob. Then, without a word, he turned on his heel
and walked rapidly toward the athletic house, his
face sullen, and the angry flush still in his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister followed the other men with a springy
step and a heart fairly bursting with joy. At last
he was back with the boys. It seemed almost as if
he had never left them. He did not worry over the
fact that, after these brief, fleeting minutes were over,
he could never play again. He only knew that the
team was in a bad way and needed him, and he resolved
that he would play as he had never played before.</p>

<p class='c002'>One after the other the fellows recognized him and
greeted him with short, hurried words, which were
an odd blending of surprise, joy, and relief; but all
had such a ring of sincerity and truth that Hollister
was more touched than he would have thought possible.</p>

<p class='c002'>He dared not meet Merriwell’s glance. He had
broken his promise, and he was not sorry; he hated
to think of what Dick’s opinion of him would be from
this time forth.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then, as he crouched in his place, he forgot Merriwell,
forgot everything but the fact that he was back
in the line again.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Are you all ready?” asked the referee.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was no reply. Only here and there a foot
moved uneasily as weights were thrown forward, and
there was a general, almost imperceptible, tightening
of nerves and muscles.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then the whistle shrilled.</p>

<p class='c002'>Those who watched the game that day said afterward
that, in all their experience, they had never seen
such an amazing rallying on the part of any team
as was shown by the Yale eleven during that last
quarter.</p>

<p class='c002'>Three minutes before they had gone off the field
with dragging steps and gloomy, discouraged faces.
The followers of the blue, who crowded the stands,
felt a wave of despair sweep over them as they thought
of what might happen in that last fifteen minutes.
Many of them fully expected to see Princeton make
another touchdown, if not two, and they waited with
perfunctory, mechanical cheers, and swiftly ebbing
spirit for the beginning of the end.</p>

<p class='c002'>But the sudden, totally unexpected appearance of
Hollister seemed to work almost a miracle.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bob responded nobly. Never had he put up such
a game before. Tireless, never failing, swift as lightning,
with his brain in splendid working order, he
seemed to be all over the field at once. Dodging,
slipping through holes in the line where one would
not have thought any advance possible, blocking, cutting
off opposing runners, and interfering for runners
of his own team, it seemed as if all the pent-up,
thwarted energy of the last few days of deprivation
was being poured out now in this brief, brilliant exhibition.</p>

<p class='c002'>His work thrilled the other men with a new hope,
and stirred them to fresh endeavor, so that they were
with him heart and soul; and the pigskin was rushed
down the field swiftly and irresistibly, until the forty-yard
line was reached.</p>

<p class='c002'>Here the orange-and-black fellows seemed to recover,
and, rallying, presented such a solid line that
two downs brought barely six yards; and Yale had
to resort to a drop kick, which sent the ball forward
thirty yards, but gave it to Princeton.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then the great struggle of the day began. Inspired
by the brilliant Hollister, Yale made a strenuous,
dogged effort to score, while her opponents were
equally determined that she should not. Back and
forth surged the lines of men, never reaching within
kicking distance of either goal, and using up the
precious minutes in fiercely contesting every inch of
progress.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was a battle royal, and the spectators were so
thrilled with interest and excitement that they almost
forgot to cheer.</p>

<p class='c002'>At last, when there were but six minutes left to
play, Kenny decided to make use of one of the most
intricate and most daring of the combinations of
double plays and crisscrossing which the coaches had
worked out from Hollister’s suggestion. It was only
to be used as a last resort, and Kenny decided that
the time had come.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sixty-seven—twenty-four—thirty-two——”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny paused. Merriwell sprang back a yard.
Buckhart crept a few feet in.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Fifty-four—seventeen!” finished Kenny swiftly.</p>

<p class='c002'>The ball was snapped, Brad ran forward three
strides, Kenny turned, and the pigskin flew back. The
next instant Merriwell had the ball, and sped toward
the right end of the line. The quarter crossed in front
of him; the tackle and guard thrust back their opponents;
the Princeton line surged forward with a rush.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister plunged forward, too, as if he were intent
only on interfering in Merriwell’s behalf; but
he had a more important duty than that to perform.
Swiftly, before their opponents realized what was
being done, he and Dick changed places, Merriwell
was blocking with all his might, while Hollister, the
ball clutched tightly to him, sped round, shot through
and out onto the field, leaving a mass of waving legs
and arms many yards behind.</p>

<p class='c002'>Joy was the supreme sensation in Bob’s breast. Only
the Princeton full back threatened. The ball was safely
clutched in his right arm, his breath came easily, his
legs were strong, and the goal posts loomed down the
field and beckoned him on. This, he thought exultingly,
was the best moment that life could give.</p>

<p class='c002'>Behind, although he could not hear it for the din
of shouting from the stands, he knew the pursuit to
be in full cry. He edged farther out from the dangerous
touch line and sped on. The Princeton full back
had been deceived by the play, and had gone farther up
the field for a kick, and now down he came at full
speed.</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister seemed to hesitate and falter. The full
back prepared to tackle. His broad back was bent
far over, his sturdy legs squared themselves, and, when
Bob was almost within his reach, he dove forward.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a sudden gasp from the spectators, a
breathless hush, and then a thunderous roar of joy,
as Hollister leaped high in the air, cleared the hooking
arms, stumbled, got his balance again, and ran on,
free, the ball still cupped in the curve of his arm.</p>

<p class='c002'>The momentary pause had served to bring the foremost
of the other pursuers almost to Bob’s heels.</p>

<p class='c002'>And now the plucky end began to feel the effects
of his strenuous work. His breath came irregularly,
his throat was parching, his legs ached with every
bound, but still he never wavered. Behind him sounded
the thud of relentless feet. He dared not look back
lest he stumble. Every second he expected to feel the
clutch of the enemy. Presently he gave up trying
to breathe; it was too hard. His head was swimming
and his lungs seemed bursting.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then his wandering faculties rushed back at a
bound as he fancied he felt a touch—just the lightest
fingering—and, gathering all his remaining strength,
he increased his pace for a few steps.</p>

<p class='c002'>The ten-yard line passed, slowly, reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“One more,” he thought. “Only one more!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The great stands were hoarse with shouting, for
here ended the game.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nearer and nearer crept the five-yard line; nearer
and nearer crept the pursuers. Once more Hollister
called upon his strength, and tried to draw away, but
it was useless. And, with the goal line but four
yards distant, stout arms were clasped tightly around
his waist.</p>

<p class='c002'>One—two—three strides he made. The goal line
writhed before his dizzy sight. Relentlessly the clutching
grasp fastened tighter and tighter about him like
bands of steel, and settled lower and lower until his
legs were clasped and he could move no farther. Despairingly
he thrust the ball out at arm’s length, and
tried to throw himself forward; the trampled turf
rose to meet him, and then blackness came.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bob’s first waking thought was that he must be
back on the rocky shores of Maine, where he had spent
the past summer. Surely those were breakers which
roared and thundered in his ears. Then he opened
his eyes, and found that he was lying on the sod, a
sweater under his head, and several vaguely familiar
faces swimming above him.</p>

<p class='c002'>A moment later he knew that it was not surf, but
the wild yelling and cheering of excited, enthusiastic
thousands. Back and forth rolled the mighty torrents
of sound, breaking and crashing in reverberations.</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly there was a pause, and then a fresh outburst,
this time deliberate and controlled:</p>

<p class='c002'>“Rah, rah rah! Rah, rah, rah! Rah, rah, rah!
Hollister! Hollister! Hollister!”</p>

<p class='c002'>No need to tell him in so many words that the ball
had gone over. This was enough. They were cheering
for him, and, as he opened his eyes again, something
like a mist came over them. Presently this
cleared away, and he found himself looking into Merriwell’s
face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How are you feeling, old fellow?” the senior asked
anxiously. “Hurt any place? Or is it just wind you
want?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s all,” he said quickly. “Be all right in a
minute.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He hesitated for an instant.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Say, Dick.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell bent lower.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I couldn’t help it, old man,” Bob said in a low
tone. “I broke my promise, and I reckon you must
think me an awful rotter. I held out as long as I
could; but you needed me, Dick, and I couldn’t sit
there and see the fellows licked. But it’s the last
time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Do you really mean that, Bob?” Merriwell asked
slowly. “Don’t you think that the next game you
see will tempt you just as you have been tempted to-day?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hollister shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, sir!” he said emphatically. “I’m through. This
is the last. I’ll be content now to cut it out for good.
I’ve shown what I could do, and——”</p>

<p class='c002'>Another thunderous burst of cheering came from
the stands.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hollister! Hollister! Hollister!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not even for that would I break my word to you
again, Merriwell. You believe me, don’t you, old fellow?”</p>

<p class='c002'>For an instant Dick gazed keenly into the anxious
eyes of his friend. Then his face cleared and a smile
curved the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sure,” he said simply.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>A CHARGE OF BIRD SHOT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It was late afternoon. Dick and several of his
friends were enjoying a brief holiday after the football
season. The sun had dropped below the line of
forest trees, but its golden rays slanted through the
naked ranks of oak and chestnut and hickory, casting
long, grotesque shadows on the mottled blanket of dead
leaves which covered the earth. Here and there a
white birch gleamed with startling distinctness against
a dark background of spruce or pine.</p>

<p class='c002'>The few remaining leaves rustled crisply in the
sharp breeze which came from the distant Sound.
Now and then one of them, loosened from its hold,
sailed slowly and silently downward in many erratic
circles, coming to rest at length on the thick carpet
of red and yellow and golden brown.</p>

<p class='c002'>The tang of autumn was in the air. The sense of
nature’s decay was evident everywhere. The very
smell of fall, subtle and impalpable, but nevertheless
unmistakable, was in the nostrils of the five men who
rustled, single file, along the scarcely perceptible path
which wound through the trees.</p>

<p class='c002'>Even Lysander Cobmore, the lean, wrinkled, weatherworn
farmer who led the way, felt it in his blood,
though he was not, perhaps, so acutely conscious of it
as were the four Yale men who followed him. He
viewed the coming of autumn with more or less mixed
feelings. It heralded the approach of a long season of
rest and hibernation which would be welcome after
the strenuous work of the past summer. But it also
meant snow and ice and many days of bitter cold
when one would not venture far from the glowing
kitchen stove. However, the crops had been successfully
harvested and were under cover, and he was content
to take things easy until the coming of the spring
should start the ball rolling again.</p>

<p class='c002'>To Dick Merriwell and his three college mates, Brad
Buckhart, Eric Fitzgerald, and Teddy Baxter, there
was almost a feeling of intoxication in the crisp, cool
air which sent their blood racing through their veins;
in the delightful, earthy, leafy smell of everything;
even in the gaunt, wintry look of the naked trees
through which one could follow so easily the whirring
flight of the partridge, or the swift, low scurry of a
covey of quail.</p>

<p class='c002'>They had escaped the trammels of work for a few
days’ shooting, and were like a party of schoolboys as
they left Dick’s car, the <i>Wizard</i>, in one of Cobmore’s
barns and followed their guide with springy steps and
eagerly sniffing nostrils through the rustling woods
toward the spot where they proposed to make their
headquarters.</p>

<p class='c002'>“The house hasn’t been vacant very long, then?”
Dick remarked presently.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Three weeks gone ter-morrer since old man Hickey
was buried,” returned Cobmore, without glancing
around. “Fur all he lived so long alone, you folks’ll
find everythin’ neat’s a pin. I’ve bin over twice sence
young Lawrence give me charge of it, an’ thar ain’t a
thing out of place.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Is that Barry Lawrence?” Merriwell asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yep. Know him?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes; he’s a Yale man. You remember him, don’t
you, Brad? He graduated three years ago.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You bet I do,” returned the Texan promptly.
“Didn’t he play end on the varsity? Nice chap, too.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What relation was he to Mr. Hickey?” Dick inquired.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nephy. Folks was sorter surprised when Hickey
left everythin’ to him an’ cut out his darter’s husband,
Andy Jellison, but I kinder smelled a rat myself,
knowin’ that they wan’t on speakin’ terms sence the
darter died three years ago come next spring. They
do say he treated her like a dog, an’ she wan’t in her
grave two months before he up an’ married another
woman. Andy done his best to make up with the old
man, but it wan’t no use. Reckon he was thinkin’ o’
the spondulicks the old man would leave—he had a
tidy little pile besides the place—an’ I s’pose he was
arter his share.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, I remember the first time he come for a
visit arter the darter died. He driv over to my place
from the village an’ put his team up in the barn. Had
a couple of grips with him an’ I nachurally thinks he’d
want help to git ’em over, but don’t you believe it.
Said he’d go by himself. I wan’t so surprised when
I happens to lift up one o’ the grips an’ finds it light’s
a feather. Couldn’t have bin nothin’ in it at all,
though why he wants to lug two empty grips three
miles through the woods, goodness knows.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Howsomever, that was his business, an’ I didn’t
ask no questions, though I couldn’t help wonderin’.
He starts off about five o’clock, an’ drat my buttons if
he wan’t back about sundown, cussin’, swearin’ mad.
He was a turrible profane man, was Jellison, but that
night he beat the record. He calls Hickey all the
names on the calendar, and got so bad I had to shet
the kitchen door so Maria wouldn’t hear him, she bein’
a good church member an’ pious.</p>

<p class='c002'>“When he calms down a bit I finds that the old man
wouldn’t let him in the house. Said he never wanted
to set eyes on him ag’in, an’ told him to go to the hot
place, I reckon. Andy had to stop with me that night,
an’ next mornin’ he went back to the city, where he
works in a bank.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, sir, all that summer he kep’ tryin’ to make up
with old Hickey. ‘Bout every two weeks he’d show up
for another try, but it wan’t any use. I could ‘a’ told
him he was wastin’ his time, fer when the old man
made up his mind, he stayed sot. But it wan’t none o’
my business, so I jest let him keep on ‘till he found
out hisself. As I says, he kep’ comin’ all summer
long, an’ then, about this time two years gone, he giv
it up, an’ I ain’t seen him sence. I allus wondered
though why in time he kep’ packin’ them empty grips
along with him; but I ain’t never discovered it, an’
don’t reckon I ever will.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell smiled at the old fellow’s tone of regret.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Maybe he had left some clothes, or something like
that, in the house, which he wanted to take away,” he
suggested.</p>

<p class='c002'>Lysander Cobmore considered this for a moment in
silence. Then he shook his head slowly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That don’t seem nachural, some ways,” he returned.
“Old man Hickey was that set agin’ Jellison
he’d ‘a’ throwed anythin’ he owned outer the winder.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“On account of the way he behaved to the daughter,
I suppose?” Dick mused.</p>

<p class='c002'>Cobmore wagged his stubby chin whisker emphatically.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s what,” he returned quickly. “Some said he
took to runnin’ with this other woman, an’ that’s what
killed her. Waal, I ain’t sorry the way things has
turned out. Jellison ain’t the sort of man I like to
have dealings with. Tew cantankerous, you know.
Now Lawrence is a nice, pleasant-spoken young feller,
an’ lets me make what I kin, lettin’ the house to folks
as is out huntin’ like you boys. ’Tain’t likely Jellison
would——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He broke off abruptly as the crash of a gun sounded
with startling distinctness from the silent woods. The
next instant came a pattering shower of fine shot
which cut the twigs and branches of the near-by
bushes, and caused each man to duck instinctively.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell was the first of the party to recover his
presence of mind.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Stop that, you lunatic!” he shouted, his face dark
with anger.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Came mighty near losing an eye,” growled Buckhart,
wiping away a drop of blood where one of the
shots had grazed his face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come out here and show yourself!” cried Fitzgerald,
replacing the soft felt hat which had been
knocked off.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, consarn ye!” exclaimed Lysander Cobmore,
shaking a lean fist toward the woods. “What in time
d’ye mean?”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was no reply, but Merriwell’s keen ear caught
a faint rustling among the leaves.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m going to see who the idiot is,” he said, in a
low tone. “If we’re to stay around here, we can’t
be running the risk of being shot in the back any
minute.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without waiting for a reply, he darted through the
undergrowth and disappeared. Brad was at his heels,
and a moment later the remainder of the party heard a
smothered exclamation, followed by the sound of
talking, in which they distinguished the tones of a
strange voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then the crashing through the bushes was resumed,
and presently three figures appeared in sight. Fitzgerald
chuckled suddenly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Pipe the willie-boy, Teddy,” he said, in a low
tone. “Wouldn’t that frost you! Bet he took us for
deer.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“He looks like the kind that would,” Baxter returned,
with a grin.</p>

<p class='c002'>They watched with considerable curiosity the approach
of the stranger, who walked between Brad and
Dick and was talking in a high-pitched, excited voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was small and undersized, with stooping shoulders
and a rather insignificant face. He was dressed
from head to foot in khaki, which was very palpably
brand new and made him ludicrously resemble one of
the wooden dummies which tailors use to show off
their goods.</p>

<p class='c002'>Apparently he had gone into a sporting-goods establishment
and purchased everything the clerk offered,
even to a revolver which hung in a leather
holster at one side of the broad belt, and a large hunting
knife stuck into the other. In one gloved hand
he held a double-barrel, sixteen-gauge shotgun which
he clasped by the end of the barrel, letting the stock
drag through the leaves behind him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Grathious thakes!” he lisped excitedly, as he came
up to the path. “I was never tho dithurbed in all my
life. I give you my word I thought ith wath a deer,
or I thould never have fired in thith world.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Brad looked at him contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I should think any fool would know the difference
between a deer and five men!” he snapped. “Besides,
there aren’t any deer around here; and if there were,
how in thunder did you expect to hit one with that
gun?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The stranger’s eyes widened with surprise.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You don’t thay tho!” he exclaimed in a distressed
tone. “Why, I thought there were deer all over.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Did you expect to kill one with a sixteen-gauge
shotgun?” Dick asked, a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>The hunter looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’th the matter with it?” he asked. “Theemth
to me the bulletth are big enough to kill anything.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald shrieked with laughter.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Bullets!” he cried hysterically. “He don’t know
the difference between shells and bullets!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell and Baxter smiled broadly. In spite of
his anger, the Texan could not repress a grin. Even
Lysander Cobmore chuckled dryly.</p>

<p class='c002'>The stranger glanced from one laughing face to
another, and then drew himself up with a comical expression
of dignity.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I can’t thay I thee the point,” he remarked stiffly.
“Thomthing theems to thrike you gentlemen ath very
funny.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitz looked at his face and went off into another
peal of laughter.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Do you really mean to say you thought the shells
you put into your gun consisted of a single bullet?”
Dick asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, I thuppothed tho,” the small man answered
shortly. “I don’t know that I thought much about it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He rested one hand over the barrel of his gun as if
it were a walking stick.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” Merriwell said
quickly. “That gun’s loaded, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, no. I jutht thot it off.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Didn’t you have two shells in it?” Dick asked.</p>

<p class='c002'>The stranger suddenly snatched his hand away with
a look of horror.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Bah Jove!” he cried excitedly. “You’re wight
about that. Mercy thakes! I might have thot a hole
wight through my hand.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The thought of his narrow escape seemed to trouble
him considerably more than anything which had yet
occurred. Dick reached forward, and, picking up the
gun, broke it and extracted the shell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s the safest way,” he said quietly. “It’s much
better not to walk through the woods with your gun
loaded.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Holding the shell in his hand, he took out a knife
and slit the pasteboard across, exposing the contents.</p>

<p class='c002'>“There’s what’s inside of it,” he explained, handing
it to the stranger.</p>

<p class='c002'>The latter took it gingerly and inspected it with
much curiosity.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, well,” he commented. “Tho thatth what it
ith. A lot of little bulletth. Quite a cute idea, ithn’t
it? Giveth a chap more chance to hit thomething, I
thuppothe.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald threatening another outburst, Dick
abruptly changed the subject.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Are you stopping near here, Mr. ——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He paused significantly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Jobloth,” supplied the stranger promptly. “Perthy
Jobloth, of Commonwealth Avenue, Bothton. No, I
jutht came up for the day, but I thuppoth there will
be no trouble getting accomodations in the village
hotel.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell glanced at Cobmore rather dubiously.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thar ain’t no hotel,” returned the farmer with
twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>Joblots looked aghast.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No hotel!” he gasped. “Grathiouth thaketh!
Whatever thall I do? It’th much too late to get back
to the city.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yep,” Cobmore said with a distinct relish. “Ain’t
no train now till mornin’. You should hev took the
five-ten.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He seemed to be extracting considerable amusement
out of Mr. Percy Joblots’ predicament.</p>

<p class='c002'>The latter was most distressed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’th what I meant to do,” he explained sadly;
“but I got tho interethted in my thooting, and the
woodth looked tho lovely, that I mithed it. My goodneth
grathouth! I don’t know what to do. Whoever
would think there wath no hotel!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He looked so utterly woebegone and crestfallen that
Dick felt sorry for him. Of course they could take
him in for the night, but he wasn’t particularly anxious
to have a stranger around who was apt to be a
damper on their fun. Still the man could not stay
out in the woods all night, and it seemed foolish to
insist on his going back to Lysander Cobmore’s when
their own destination was so close at hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>He glanced questioningly at his three friends. They
had quite as much say as he had.</p>

<p class='c002'>Buckhart shrugged his shoulders indifferently; apparently
it made no difference to him what became
of Mr. Joblots. Fitz nodded emphatically, a broad
grin on his expressive face. Evidently he saw possibilities
for mirth in the presence of the stranger. Baxter
seemed not to care one way or another.</p>

<p class='c002'>At least it would only be for one night, Dick reflected,
turning to the dapper little fellow.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’d better come along with us, Mr. Joblots,” he
said. “We are on our way to a farmhouse which we
are going to make our headquarters for a few days. I
imagine there will be room enough for you to stay to-night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He glanced inquiringly at the farmer, who nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Room an’ to spare,” he said tersely, “an’ you gents
had better be gittin’ on if you want to git thar before
dark.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Percy Joblots was overjoyed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That-th extremely kind of you,” he said gratefully.
“It relievth me from a motht unpleathant
prediciment. I really don’t know what I thould have
done but for you, bah Jove!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, that’s settled,” Dick said shortly, “and we’d
better get on. My name is Dick Merriwell, and these
are my friends, Brad Buckhart, Eric Fitzgerald, and
Teddy Baxter, all of Yale.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Delighted, I’m thure,” murmured Joblots, as the
party resumed their way along the path. “Of Yale!
Dear me! How many dear friendth I have had from
New Haven.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You didn’t graduate from there yourself, by any
chance, did you?” inquired Fitz.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, I—er—wath educated at home by—er—tutorth,”
returned the little fellow hastily.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Perhaps you know some one who is there now,”
persisted Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, no, I think not. Motht of my friendth have
graduated. Let me thee, though. Do you know a
chap named McCormick?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, of course,” returned Fitz quickly. “Archie
McCormick. Dandy fellow, he is, too. Know him?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Joblots hesitated.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, I——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He broke off abruptly as they emerged from the
thicket into a wide clearing which sloped gently down
from the forest to the shores of a beautiful little lake,
whose waters, ruffled by the brisk breeze, reflected
the riotous crimson and gold of the autumn sunset
until it seemed almost like a radiant opal.</p>

<p class='c002'>A little way down the slope to their right loomed the
spreading bulk of a commodious, weatherworn farmhouse,
with big, hospitable, chimneys and many small
paned windows, each one of which reflected the sunset
in flaming crimson until it looked as if the whole
house was ablaze.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Waal, boys,” remarked Cobmore. “Here we be.
This is Cranberry Lake, an’ old man Hickey’s house
still stands. I reckon you feel like gittin’ a fire started
an’ cookin’ grub. It’s nigh onto supper time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re right, there,” Fitzgerald said, smacking
his lips. “This air has given me such a thundering
appetite I could pretty near eat the soles of my shoes.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The farmer chuckled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Ain’t quite that far gone, I expect,” he said. “You
got somethin’ a bit tastier than that to fall to on.
Let’s git around to the front door.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The house faced the lake, and on that side was a
narrow veranda which ran the full width of the
building. As they turned the corner they were surprised
beyond measure to see a tall figure rise from
the steps and look inquiringly toward them.</p>

<p class='c002'>The next instant Buckhart gave a sudden exclamation.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By thunder! If it isn’t Mac! What the mischief
are you doing here, old fellow?”</p>
<div class='pbb'>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER X<br /> <br /><span class='small'>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Archie McCormick hesitated for the fraction of a
second and then laughed heartily.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, of all the coincidences!” he exclaimed.
“Dick, too, and Fitz and Teddy! That doesn’t happen
to be Barry Lawrence behind you, does it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick looked a little surprised.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Lawrence? No,” he returned as they reached the
steps. “This is Mr. Percy Joblots, of Boston. I had
an idea he was a friend of yours.”</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick looked frankly puzzled, and, as Dick
shot a quick glance at Joblots, he caught an odd expression
of keen alertness in his eyes which was so
much at variance with their usual blank inanity that
the Yale man was puzzled. The next instant it had
disappeared and the dapper fellow stepped forward
with outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Delighted, I’m thure, Mr. McCormick,” he said.
“I’ve heard about you from thomebody, but at the
moment I can’t for the life of me think which of my
friendth it wath.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Glad to meet you,” McCormick said rather shortly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then he turned quickly to Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I was hoping Barry might be with you,” he said.
“I met him in Hartford yesterday, and we planned
to come up here for a couple of days’ gunning. You
know he owns the shack here, and he was to be here
at five o’clock. I’ve been waiting here since a little
after four, but haven’t seen hide or hair of him. I
was just beginning to think of breaking through a
window and making myself as comfortable as I could
for the night, when you appeared.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s funny,” Dick said thoughtfully. “We came
over with exactly that same idea in view. Made arrangements
with Cobmore here, who is Lawrence’s
agent, to take the place for the rest of the week. Did
he say anything to you about coming here himself?”</p>

<p class='c002'>He looked at Cobmore as he spoke, and the farmer
shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nary a word,” he returned emphatically. “It’s
news to me. He most generally lets me know a couple
of days before he wants it, so thar won’t be nobody
else here. Be you sure, young feller, it was Barry
Lawrence you made them arrangements with?”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a faint, but unmistakable note of incredulity
in his voice which brought the color into
McCormick’s face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course it was,” he said tartly. “You don’t
think I’d take it upon myself to come here without his
invitation, do you? We made all the arrangements
last night, and would have come down together, but
Barry had to go to New York this morning and wasn’t
sure what train he would make back. So we decided
to meet here. He said he wouldn’t be later than five,
but I suppose something has happened to detain him.
Very likely he’ll be down later.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’ll be a hang sight later, then,” the farmer grumbled,
as he mounted the steps and drew out a bunch
of keys. “There ain’t no train on this branch till te-rmorrer
morning.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What difference does it make, anyway?” Dick said
lightly. “We’ll have a bang-up time together, and if
Lawrence shows up he’ll just have to join in with
us. After getting this far I don’t feel like turning
around and going back, especially when he hasn’t
even appeared on the scene.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Cobmore turned the key in the lock and swung the
door open.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thar you be, gents,” he said. “Make yourselves
to hum. You’ve got all the grub you need to-night,
an’ ter-morrer I’ll send Jake over with milk and butter
an’ a few eggs. I got to be gittin’ back, or the old
lady’ll raise my hair.”</p>

<p class='c002'>They bade him good night and he disappeared into
the rapidly falling shadows, while the young fellows
trooped riotously into the house.</p>

<p class='c002'>On a stand in the hall they found a candle and
matches, which they lit at once and commenced a tour
of inspection.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was a typical New England farmhouse of the better
class, rather more spacious, perhaps, than the majority,
and certainly more rambling. The original
central building, square and severely plain, had been
added to from time to time, a room here, a wing there,
until the size of the house had been more than doubled.</p>

<p class='c002'>This effect was heightened by the long kitchen extension
protruding at the rear, which was connected,
through the milk room and woodsheds, to the big barn
behind, so that the whole mass of buildings, all weatherworn
to a harmonious gray, had quite an imposing
appearance.</p>

<p class='c002'>The explorers passed through a room on the right
of the hall, which seemed to have been used as a
sitting room, and into the dining room behind, which
had evidently been the original kitchen. There was
a huge chimney here which was not plastered up as
it is in many old houses, but gaped wide, a glorious,
cavernous opening so vast that it took up almost the
entire end of the room, and could accommodate five-foot
logs with ease. The hearth, which extended far
out into the room, was made of square stone slabs
of varying sizes, all of which had been worn smooth
by the feet of many generations.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Gee! What a dandy fireplace!” Fitzgerald exclaimed,
as he paused before it in admiration. “The
late Mr. Hickey certainly had good taste. Can’t you
imagine toasting your feet here of a cold winter’s
night, with the wind howling around outside and a
regular blizzard raging?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“We’ll have to try it after supper,” Dick said. “We
can’t scrape up a blizzard for you, Fitz, but I expect
it will be cold enough for a fire, all the same.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You bet your boots,” Buckhart put in. “I’m cold
already.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“My goodneth, yeth!” agreed Joblots, shivering in
his resplendant hunting suit. “No furnace heat, I
thuppoth.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitz snickered, and they passed on to the kitchen,
which proved to be fitted up with a modern range and
all the conveniences. In fact, the whole house was
comfortably furnished to the smallest detail, and everything
was so clean and neat and attractive that the
fellows were highly elated at their good fortune.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s too comfortable altogether,” Baxter said, as
they congregated in the kitchen, unpacking the supplies
they had brought along. “We won’t feel as if
we were camping out at all.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You have my full permission to spread a blanket
out in the grass, my child, if this is too rich for your
blood,” Fitz remarked as he perched himself on the
table and proceeded to slice bacon. “Me for the comforts
of home, though, when they’re around. Camping
out is all very nice when you’ve got to; but I fail
to see the fun in waking up so stiff you can hardly
move, with a cold in your head, sand all through your
clothes, and covered from head to foot with nasty,
itching bites from black flies or mosquitoes.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, come off, little one!” Buckhart put in. “It’s
clear you’re not wise to the real joys of camping out
when you talk like that. Who cares for such little
things as black flies and sand when you’re lying on a
bed of balsam boughs, wrapped up in a good blanket,
with your feet to the fire and three or four good
chums around to talk to or not, as you like? Nothing
but the stars above your head, no walls to keep you
from breathing all of God’s clean air you can get into
your lungs. I tell you, tender one, that’s the best sort
of a life to live. You hear me gently warble!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sounds good,” Fitz retorted airily; “but how
about the times when there aren’t any stars above your
head and when God’s clean rain washes you off that
nice balsam bed and gives you a bath when you’d a
heap sight rather stay dirty. Not for this child! I
have a foolish preference for a roof over me and some
kind of a mattress, even if it’s only corn husks, to
sleep on.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Buckhart was about to make an emphatic rejoinder
when he caught Dick’s laughing eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re wasting your breath, old fellow,” the latter
said quickly. “Fitz is awfully fond of hearing
himself talk, but don’t ever ask him to go camping if
you don’t expect to be taken up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Slander,” retorted the slim chap; “vile slander!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He dived into the basket of provisions and brought
forth a bottle wrapped in a newspaper.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Pickles!” he exclaimed, holding it up. “Joy of my
heart! How blessed of you, Richard, to remember
my fondness——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He stopped abruptly as his quick eye caught something
on the printed page which was around the bottle.
For a moment there was silence. Then his eyes
widened alarmingly and his whole face took on an
expression of mock horror as he fixed an accusing
glare on the placid countenance of Archie McCormick.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, gay deceiver!” he exclaimed severely. “Oh,
sly fox! Oh, foolish mortal to think you could keep
a secret from the sharp eyes of Desperate Desmond,
the Demon Detective of—er—Duluth.”</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick grinned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Discovered!” he moaned. “And I thought I had
covered me tracks so well! Out with it, Dessy. Keep
me no longer in suspenders.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald rolled his eyes ceilingward.</p>

<p class='c002'>“All day long have I felt a presentiment of approaching
evil,” he groaned. “This morning a perfectly
black cat winked at me——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“The saucy thing!” interrupted Baxter. “I hope
it wasn’t a lady cat.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Winked at me,” continued Fitz, frowning at him;
“and that is always a bad omen. But I never thought
of this. Even when you announced your trip to Hartford
two days ago upon a most flimsy pretext, I did
not suspect, but now I know.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He paused and glared again at McCormick who was
grinning from ear to ear. By this time the others
were rather curious; Percy Joblots, in particular, sat
gaping in astonishment, apparently not knowing quite
how to take the erratic Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Spit it out, why don’t you?” demanded Buckhart.
“You’ll throw a fit if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitz swallowed hard and rolled his eyes again.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s my sympathetic nature struggling with an innate
sense of justice,” he explained. “But justice triumphs.
I know now why you made that mysterious
trip to Hartford. On this scrap of paper placed providentially
before my eyes—redeemed thus from the
ignomy of being a mere wrapper of plebeian pickles,
I see a horrible—an appalling—thing.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He paused again, dramatically, and Buckhart, exasperated
beyond endurance, made a sudden dive for
him. The slim chap leaped from the table and slipped
around behind it.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Peace, creature!” he declaimed. “Listen to my
news. The Second National Bank of Hartford was
robbed last night of thirty thousand dollars in cold
cash!”</p>

<p class='c002'>For a moment there was silence. Then a roar of
laughter went up.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re pinched, Mac,” Dick gasped. “Desperate
Desmond has found you out.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, bucko,” the Texan exclaimed; “better confess
and divvy up the swag.”</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick flushed a little, and the smile on his
pleasant face grew a bit forced.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Looks that way, doesn’t it?” he said, in a bantering
tone. “I didn’t know he was so smart.”</p>

<p class='c002'>At that moment Merriwell, happening to glance at
Percy Joblots, noticed that he was watching McCormick
covertly, but with a strange intentness. In his
eyes was that curious look of keenness which Dick
had seen once before that night.</p>

<p class='c002'>But even as he looked, the expression disappeared
and the dapper fellow’s face resumed its customary
repose.</p>

<p class='c002'>“But, I thay!” he exclaimed, turning to Fitzgerald.
“Thurely you don’t weally mean that?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The slim chap choked and turned red, but his face
was quite serious.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Isn’t it an awful thing?” he questioned sadly. “I
don’t think I shall ever recover from the shock.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell noticed McCormick’s distress, and it suddenly
occurred to him that Archie’s only brother had
been sentenced unjustly to a term in Sing Sing for
embezzlement. Naturally the youth would think of
him whenever the subject of bank robberies was
broached, and he decided that the joke had gone a
little too far.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Stop your nonsense, Fitz,” he said quickly, “and
fry that bacon. You’ve been idling there quite long
enough.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But how about this robbery?” persisted Buckhart,
who had become interested. “Did they get away?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“See for yourself,” Fitzgerald returned, tossing the
paper to him. “I have work to do.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Brad caught the scrap of newspaper and carried it
to the lamp.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thirty thousand dollars,” he mumbled. “Regular
professional job—confederate—traced to——By
thunder, boys! They were traced to Middleberry.
What do you think of that? Traced to Middleberry
and then lost track of.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Middleberry being the nearest railroad town and
not more than twelve miles away, this announcement
created considerable interest. Every one desired to
learn all the particulars, which were meager enough;
and then they began to speculate on where the robbers
would naturally hide themselves. The country
thereabouts was sparsely settled, many of the farms
having been abandoned, and the thick woods offered
plenty of chances for secure retreats.</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitz was quite excited over the possibility of their
coming upon the thieves and had even decided how
he would spend his portion of the reward, when the
ravishing odor of frying bacon, combined with the
equally alluring fragrance of the coffee, drove all
other thoughts out of their heads; and presently they
settled down to supper with appetites which only a
long tramp through the woods in the crisp, bracing air
of mid-November can give, and for a time conversation
languished, while everything eatable in sight was
disposed of with remarkable rapidity and thoroughness.</p>

<p class='c002'>“There!” sighed Fitzgerald, with a searching look
at the empty dishes. “No more worlds to conquer.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thunder, little one!” exploded the Texan. “You
sure aren’t looking for anything more to eat! You’ve
stowed away twice as much as any man here. Where
do you put it all?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Where do you suppose?” demanded the slim chap.
“I’ve got a good healthy appetite, that’s all. I notice
you haven’t been exactly backward yourself.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick sprang up and began gathering the dishes together.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You fellows go ahead and start the fire in the next
room while Mac and I wash up,” he said. “There’s a
lot of big logs out in the woodshed.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Brad, Fitz and Baxter promptly departed thither,
while McCormick filled the dish pan with water from
the kettle and Merriwell dumped his armful of dishes
into it. Percy Joblots hovered about as if he did not
know exactly what to do.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Ithn’t there thomething I can do?” he asked presently,
in a helpless sort of manner. “I never wathed
dithes, but I might try.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick’s lips twitched, but he managed to keep a
straight face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Two’s about enough for that, I think,” he returned.
“You might see if you can find some newspapers to
start the fire with.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The dapper fellow looked vaguely about the kitchen,
but, there being nothing of the sort in sight, his eyes
returned blankly to Dick’s face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t thee any,” he said plaintively.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Take a candle, then, and look through the other
rooms,” Merriwell retorted rather sharply.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was beginning to tire a little of the fellow’s absolute
thick-headedness.</p>

<p class='c002'>Joblots still hesitated. It seemed almost as if he
did not wish to leave the kitchen, but presently he
lighted a candle and departed reluctantly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Where in the mischief did you get hold of that?”
McCormick asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled at the other’s tone of contempt.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Picked him up in the woods about a mile down
the path,” he explained. “He fired a charge of bird
shot at us, and when we got hold of him we found
he’d come out for the day’s shooting, missed the last
train back, and hadn’t a notion of where he was going
to put up to-night. There’s plenty of room here,
so we thought he might as well stay and go back in the
morning. He doesn’t know one end of a gun from the
other, and I shall feel safer when he’s out of the
woods.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Humph!” grunted McCormick. “I never ran up
against such a chump in all my life. He’s a blockhead.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick did not answer at once. He was thinking of
the expression he had surprised on the face of the
would-be sportsman a little while ago. It was not in
the least like the look of a man lacking in sense. He
wondered whether Mr. Percy Joblots was quite such
a fool as appeared at first sight.</p>

<p class='c002'>“He does seem pretty inane, doesn’t he?” Merriwell
remarked presently. “Funny thing, though, Mac. He
was saying that he knew a lot of Yale men, and, when
Fitz asked him if they were still at New Haven, he
asked about you!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“About me?” Archie exclaimed incredulously.
“Why I never saw the jackass before in my life!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t know that he said he knew you,” Dick returned,
“but he gave that impression. Anyway, he
knew your name.”</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick’s face took on a puzzled look.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s queer,” he mused. “Wonder where the
deuce he got hold of it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick did not answer. His quick ear had caught
the sound of a soft footfall in the adjoining room, and
the next moment Joblots appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I found thome,” he said, holding up a bunch of
newspapers. “Big pile of them in the fwont woom.
What thall I do with them?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just crumple them up and put them in the fireplace,”
Merriwell answered. “Never mind. Here are
some of the fellows now. They’ll fix it up all right.”</p>

<p class='c002'>As he spoke the door to the woodshed opened and
the three men appeared carrying four or five big logs
and a lot of kindling. They proceeded at once to lay
them in the dining-room fireplace, and by the time the
dishes were washed a roaring fire was blazing up the
cavernous chimney.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s all to the good,” Dick remarked, as he and
Archie joined the circle about the hearth. “It certainly
is cold outside.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“It sure is, pard,” Buckhart agreed. “That woodshed
was like an ice house.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald had dragged a sofa up to one side of the
blaze and sprawled full length on it.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I tell you, fellows, we’ll want to put in the night
right here,” he remarked. “I hate to think of leaving
this lovely warm spot and crawling in between icy
sheets.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Humph!” snorted the Texan. “How about that
mattress you were making such a time about a while
back?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The slim chap patted the stuffed couch appreciatively.</p>

<p class='c002'>“This is as good as any mattress,” he retorted.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Where do we come in?” demanded McCormick.
“I suppose we can sit up all night on plain chairs.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Buckhart’s mouth drew down into a firm line.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nix on that!” he said emphatically. “No breaking
away from the bunch. When we go to bed, little Fitzy
will toddle along, too, if I have to tuck him in myself.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald lay back comfortably, his eyes fixed
dreamily on the dancing flames.</p>

<p class='c002'>“When we capture those bank robbers and divide
up the reward,” he mused presently, “I think I’ll buy
just such a place as this with my share.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell’s eyes gleamed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Counting your chickens a little previously, aren’t
you, Fitz?” he smiled. “There hasn’t been any reward
offered yet. How do you know there will be?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, of course there will,” the slim chap blurted.
“Who ever heard of a bank robbery and no reward.
Absurd!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I wonder if that paper got it straight about their
being traced to Middleberry,” Baxter put in. “It
would be funny if we should run into them while
we’re out to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hard to tell,” Dick returned. “Personally I’m not
going to bother my head about them. We came out to
shoot, and that’s what I’m going to do.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But still,” persisted Fitzgerald, “if we——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He stopped abruptly, and his eyes opened wide.
Merriwell also stiffened with a look of keen attention,
and in the stillness which followed there came the
sound of the front door being opened and closed again.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Barry!” McCormick exclaimed, his eyes brightening.</p>

<p class='c002'>No one else spoke. They had all turned toward the
door of the sitting room and were watching it with
intent interest, for, after a momentary pause in the
hall, the sound of footsteps on the bare floor was unmistakable,
coming nearer and nearer.</p>

<p class='c002'>The next instant the figure of a man loomed in the
doorway and stopped still, his keen, dark eyes flashing
swiftly from one surprised face to another. He was
fairly tall, and rather dark, with coal-black hair and a
crisp, well-clipped, black mustache. His features were
good, but his face wore an expression of domineering
harshness which did not improve it. It was evident
that he was a man accustomed to having his own way.
It was equally plain that at the present moment he was
restraining his anger with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c002'>And he was not Barry Lawrence, nor had any one
of the party ever laid eyes on him before.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THROUGH THE CRACK OF THE DOOR.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>For a moment the silence was unbroken. Then the
stranger stepped inside the room and set down the
suit case he carried.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well!” he snapped. “Might I ask what this
means?”</p>

<p class='c002'>He looked at Merriwell, who happened to be seated
nearest the door, and his voice quivered with suppressed
rage. Dick returned his glance calmly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You are quite at liberty to ask anything you
please,” he replied coolly; “but if you expect an answer
you’ll have to be considerably more definite.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The man’s teeth clicked together.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What do you mean by taking possession of this
house?” he ripped out. “How dare you break into
another man’s place and make yourselves at home
here? A lot of tramps and loafers! It’s outrageous!”</p>

<p class='c002'>It was true that, excepting the resplendant Joblots,
the Yale men were all attired in flannel shirts and
rather worn, rough-looking clothes; but any one in his
senses would scarcely mistake them for tramps.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick arose slowly to his feet, his face calm but his
eyes narrowing slightly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I think that will be about enough,” he said quietly,
but with an ominous undercurrent in his voice. “We’re
not tramps, and you know it. Neither have we broken
into this house. You ought to know that, too. Before
you loosen up any more on that tongue of yours,
kindly let us know who you might be and what business
you have butting in here.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The stranger’s black eyes fairly flashed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Butting in!” he exploded. “I’ll have you know
that I am Andrew Jellison, son of the man who owned
this place!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell eyed him with a new interest.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Ah, indeed,” he remarked pleasantly. “Wouldn’t
son-in-law be a little more accurate?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Jellison gave a start and darted a quick look at Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What difference does that make?” he snapped.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Quite a little, I should think,” Merriwell returned
calmly. “But you haven’t told us what right you have
here.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Right!” frothed Jellison. “Right! I’m the heir.
I own every stick and stone of the place!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Really?” Dick questioned. “I was under the impression
that it was the property of Barry Lawrence,
from whom we rented it for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Jellison’s pompous self-assertion collapsed with the
swiftness of a pricked balloon. He had evidently tried
to bluff the Yale men, having no idea that they knew
the truth, and for a moment he was nonplused.</p>

<p class='c002'>His eyes shifted about the room and he moistened
his dry lips with an equally dry tongue.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Impossible!” he muttered at length. “There wasn’t
any will. I am the heir-at-law.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I think you have been misinformed,” he said significantly.
“There was a will, which left everything to
Barry Lawrence, Mr. Hickey’s nephew.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Jellison dropped into a chair, and, taking out his
handkerchief, mopped his forehead.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’ll excuse my somewhat hasty words, I’m
sure,” he said presently. “I didn’t understand what
you were doing here, or I shouldn’t have spoken as I
did. This has been a great shock!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick dropped back into his chair without replying.
He wondered whether the shock had been as great as
Jellison would have it appear. He had a shrewd suspicion
that the man was acting. It seemed incredible
that he could really be ignorant of the fact that Hickey
had cut him off without a cent and that everything
had been left to Lawrence.</p>

<p class='c002'>What was Jellison doing here, anyway? What object
had he in appearing at nine o’clock at night, alone,
at a probably deserted farmhouse? Such conduct was
extraordinary, to say the least.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You—er—say you have rented the place for a few
days?” Jellison inquired at that moment.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes. We have taken it for the remainder of the
week.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Shooting, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was silence for a moment. Jellison appeared
to be thinking intently.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I came down for a few days’ rest,” he volunteered.
“The late flurry in the Street has pretty well worn me
out, and I knew how peaceful and quiet this place was.
I had no idea I should find any one here.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He hesitated and looked questioningly at Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m afraid I shall have to ask you to tolerate me
for to-night,” he went on slowly. “There’s no place
nearer than Cobmore’s where I could stay.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell was not at all pleased with the turn things
had taken. He and his friends had come out for a few
days’ rest and recreation. They had looked forward
for a long time to this little holiday when they would
get away by themselves and be absolutely free from
cares or worries of any sort, and they had been at
considerable pains to arrange things so they could get
off.</p>

<p class='c002'>And now three people had turned up unexpectedly—two
of them utter strangers. He did not mind McCormick,
for he was a good fellow and one of them;
but it was annoying beyond measure to have first Joblots
and then this Jellison thrust themselves in. The
whole outing would be spoiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>But he failed to see how he could very well get out
of it. It would not be decent to refuse Jellison a bed
and make him walk three miles through the forest to
Lysander Cobmore, who would, no doubt, be asleep by
the time the man got there. And, after all, it was only
for one night. They could put up with him for that
length of time.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, I guess there’s room enough,” he said slowly.
“We haven’t been upstairs yet, but I should imagine
there would be no lack of beds in a house of this
size.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, I don’t care about a bed,” Jellison said, with a
sort of suppressed eagerness. “I can turn in on that
couch there. Anything like that will be good enough.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t think you’ll have to do that,” Merriwell
returned quickly. “Suppose we take a look upstairs
and see what there is. It’s about time to hit the pillow,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His suggestion was received with much approbation.
The other fellows had grown rather restless since the
appearance of Andrew Jellison. Joblots was such an
insignificant fellow—almost a fool, in fact—that they
had not paid much attention to him and had continued
their talk and joking quite as if he were not there; but
the presence of Jellison seemed, somehow, to throw a
damper over everything, and, since the evening was
spoiled, they might just as well go to bed.</p>

<p class='c002'>One and all, they arose with alacrity, and, hunting
up candles, lighted them and started in a procession
upstairs.</p>

<p class='c002'>Their discoveries on the second floor were most satisfactory.
There were bedrooms enough to give each
one of the party a separate one if he wished it, and
Fitzgerald observed, on punching the mattresses, that
they were all of a good quality of hair.</p>

<p class='c002'>Here, even more than downstairs, the effect of the
hit-or-miss enlarging of the house was apparent. There
was very little hallway, most of the rooms opening
one out of another; but, with a crowd of this sort,
that was no inconvenience.</p>

<p class='c002'>It being decidedly cold; the fellows at once hunted
up sheets and blankets and proceeded with the greatest
expedition to make up the beds required.</p>

<p class='c002'>Andrew Jellison persisted in his desire to spend
the night on the sofa downstairs.</p>

<p class='c002'>“There’s no use in my bothering to make a bed just
for one night,” he said. “That sofa is comfortable
enough, and I shall sleep very well on it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He seemed to make such a point of it that Dick
began to wonder whether he could possibly have any
ulterior motive in wanting to be away from the rest
of the bunch, and he resolved to thwart the man just
on the chance of such a thing being the case.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nonsense!” he said positively. “There’s no trouble
making a bed. It would be perfectly absurd for
you to spend the night on a sofa. Just you take this
room off ours. It’s got a nice little single bed, and
you’ll sleep like a top.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He was so emphatical that Jellison finally gave
way, though it was with a very palpable reluctance,
and proceeded to make up the bed in the little room
which opened out of the larger bedroom at the head
of the stairs, which Merriwell had taken possession of
for Buckhart and himself.</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald and Baxter slept in one just back of that,
and McCormick chose one across the hall for himself
and Percy Joblots. When the idea was mentioned to
the dapper little fellow, however, he objected strenuously.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Weally, now, I couldn’t think of thleeping with another
perthon,” he said plaintively. “I wouldn’t clothe
an eye all night. There’th a nice little room jutht
back of thith one. I’ll make the bed all by mythelf.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He made such a point of it that Dick gave in readily
and laughingly told him to take whatever room he
chose. It at once became evident, however, that Percy
had not the most remote conception of how to make
the bed, and McCormick finally took pity on him and
did the job up in short order.</p>

<p class='c002'>At last, when matters were settled satisfactorily,
they pulled off their clothes and crawled between the
cold sheets with many shivers and gasps, which quickly
ceased; and presently, one by one, they dropped off
to sleep.</p>

<p class='c002'>Several hours later Dick Merriwell awoke with a
start and lay still listening. Just what had roused him
he did not know, but he felt that it must have been
some unusual noise, or he would never have been wakened
out of a sound sleep.</p>

<p class='c002'>The house was silent as a tomb, except for the regular
breathing which came from the Texan beside him
and from the room where Jellison lay. His first waking
thought had been that the latter was prowling
about the house for some purpose, but the heavy
breathing from the room showed that the stranger was
either sound asleep or giving a very good imitation of
it. At least he was there.</p>

<p class='c002'>What could it have been? For a long time Dick
strained his ears for a repetition of the noise, but
nothing came. At last he decided that he must have
imagined or dreamed it, and, relaxing himself, he
closed his eyes and was just dropping off again when
he opened them with a jerk and sat bolt upright in bed.</p>

<p class='c002'>His quick ear had caught the faint but unmistakable
sound of grating, as if two stones were being rubbed
against each other, which came from somewhere
downstairs.</p>

<p class='c002'>The next moment Dick crept cautiously out of bed
and slipped noiselessly into the hall. Bending over
the railing, his eyes lighted up with triumph as he
caught the faint gleam of light from the open door of
the sitting room.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was bitter cold, and he was clad in the thinnest of
pajamas, but he did not notice this as he crept cautiously
downstairs and approached the door. He was
too interested in what was going on in that room to
think of anything else.</p>

<p class='c002'>Softly he crossed the lower hall and peered through
the crack of the partly opened door. Then he saw that
the light was in the dining room, and even as he advanced
he heard a labored breathing as if some one
was either making a great physical effort, or else was
struggling under a tremendous mental strain.</p>

<p class='c002'>With every nerve tingling and his curiosity at its
highest pitch, Dick reached the door of the dining
room and looked through the crack.</p>

<p class='c002'>What he saw fairly paralyzed him with amazement.
It was only with the greatest difficulty that he caught
himself in time to prevent a gasp of surprise.</p>

<p class='c002'>The great fire had died down and only a few embers
glowed dully in the mammoth opening. The light he
had seen came from a candle which was set down on
the stone hearth, and close beside it knelt the figure of
a man clad only in pajamas. His head was bent so
that Merriwell could not see his face, but Dick was
not thinking of him at the moment. His eyes were
riveted on the gaping hole in the hearth over which
the fellow was bending. It had been made by the removal
of one of the stone slabs about eighteen inches
square, and from where he stood Dick could see the
interior quite distinctly.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was filled almost to the brim with packages of
bank notes, packed so tightly together that one could
not have inserted a finger between them.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell could scarcely believe his senses. He
rubbed his eyes in bewilderment and looked again. It
was quite true. They were bank notes—mostly yellow-backs—and
from the way they were packed together
they must represent a tremendous sum.</p>

<p class='c002'>Where had they come from? What were they doing
there? The thought of the bank robbery at Hartford
flashed into his mind, and at the same instant the
kneeling man raised his head and revealed to Merriwell’s
amazed gaze the face of Archie McCormick,
ghastly white, sweat dewed, the eyes wide and shining,
and the pale lips trembling spasmodically.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>IN THE SILENT NIGHT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Dick could not take his eyes off the face of his
friend, drawn, pale, stamped with the print of some
vital emotion. What did it mean? What could it
mean? Why had Archie stolen down here in the dead
of night? Where had the money come from?</p>

<p class='c002'>These, and a dozen other questions, equally unanswerable,
flashed through his half-dazed mind in the
brief interval before the fellow kneeling on the hearth
could move a finger. McCormick was gazing straight
at the door, and Dick half expected him to call his
name. It did not seem possible that the man could be
so blind as not to see who was watching him through
the crack.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then he saw that Archie was absolutely oblivious
to his surroundings. His eyes were cloudy and unseeing.
He was not walking in his sleep, but his mind
was so concentrated on some problem that he was blind
to all outward things.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently he uttered a shuddering sigh and reached
slowly for the stone slab which lay close at hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick waited until he had replaced it over the hole
and was leaning forward for a handful of ashes to
dust into the cracks, and then softly made his way back
to the hall and upstairs.</p>

<p class='c002'>His first impulse had been to confront Archie then
and there and get the truth from him, but now he
shrank from doing that until he had had time to think.
He knew that appearances were often deceptive and
that there might be a perfectly reasonable explanation
for the position in which he had found McCormick;
but the latter had an extremely sensitive, high-spirited
nature, and Dick felt that he would be likely to resent
any inquiries he himself might make which could not
help but show more or less suspicion.</p>

<p class='c002'>For Merriwell was suspicious. Fight as he might
against the thought, he could not help connecting what
he had just seen with the robbery of the Hartford
bank just twenty-four hours before.</p>

<p class='c002'>He did not wish to believe anything against Archie
McCormick. He had always known him as a perfectly
straightforward, truthful fellow with a very
keen sense of honor. It was incredible that he could
be connected in any way with the robbery, and yet
facts were facts and Merriwell could not help putting
two and two together.</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie had gone to Hartford two days before, ostensibly
to see a friend who lived there. That was all
right, but, unfortunately, he had reached there the
very afternoon of the night in which the bank had been
broken open. He had suddenly shown up in this deserted
spot, and the man at whose invitation he was
supposed to have come, had not yet appeared.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick remembered Cobmore’s very evident doubt of
the story that Barry Lawrence would think of visiting
the farmhouse without giving him notice.</p>

<p class='c002'>The robbers had been tracked to Middleberry and
their trail lost. Middleberry was barely twelve miles
away, and it would be a very simple matter for any
one to make their way unseen through the woods to
the house on the shores of Cranberry Lake.</p>

<p class='c002'>Last, but not least, was the presence of this hoard
of bank notes concealed under the stone hearth downstairs.
Dick felt sure that they had not belonged to
the late occupant of the place. Whatever other eccentricities
he might have had, Hickey was not a miser,
but a very shrewd old man with a decided belief in the
safety of banks. He was not the sort who would
keep his savings in the house, and, besides, Merriwell
had noticed that the packages of notes had been all
neatly tied up just as they had come from the bank.
And if they were not the spoil from the late robbery,
what were they?</p>

<p class='c002'>Lying there in the dark, Dick heard McCormick
come stealthily back upstairs and slip into his room.
And, after that, hour after hour passed as he thought
over the problem from every conceivable point of
view.</p>

<p class='c002'>He did not wish to believe his friend guilty. Some how,
he could not quite bring himself to that point, and
yet every scrap of evidence was strongly against him.</p>

<p class='c002'>He began to remember little things which he had
scarcely noticed at the time, but which now, in the
light of this new discovery, came vividly back into
his mind.</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie had not taken Fitzgerald’s joshing about the
robbery with anything like his usual good grace. He
had been palpably annoyed, and his assumption of
careless laughter had seemed a little forced.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then there was Joblots. Where did he come in?
It did not seem possible that any human being could
be such an absolute ass, though once or twice in his life
Dick had met fellows with mannerisms of which the
dapper little fellow had made a very good copy. But
Merriwell had an instinctive feeling that he was nothing
but a copy. For some reason he was playing a
part, and Merriwell felt sure that the real man was
something far different from his outward appearance.
He had been interested in McCormick from the very
first. All evening he had been watching him—covertly,
to be sure, but none the less constantly. Was it
possible that he could be following Archie?</p>

<p class='c002'>Jellison, too, was a puzzle. The absurdity of a
man’s coming alone to such a deserted spot as this and
landing there late at night, simply because he wanted
to take a few days’ rest, was palpable. There must
be some ulterior motive, and a very strong one at
that, to cause him to do what he had done; but, try
as he would, Dick could not fathom it. Presently his
mind left Jellison and leaped back to McCormick.</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie’s only brother had been sentenced to two
years in State’s prison. He had been at liberty for
six months. To be sure, both Archie and his brother
swore that the latter had been wrongly convicted,
that some one high up in the bank had in reality stolen
the money and then succeeded in weaving such a web
of false evidence around the innocent man that he
had been convicted and sentenced, the thief himself
escaping scot-free.</p>

<p class='c002'>That was possible. It was also possible that both
men had lied. They might have inherited a single bad
streak—an irresistible tendency to steal, perhaps.
Such things had been known. Jim might have committed
the actual robbery and Archie helped him get
away with the spoils.</p>

<p class='c002'>So Merriwell tossed about through the long hours
of the night, struggling between his innate loyalty and
devotion to his friend and the evidence of his eyesight
and his common sense. At last, toward morning, he
fell into a troubled sleep and dreamed strange, fantastic
dreams in which Archie and Jellison and Percy
Joblots were mixed up in a vague, shadowy, perfectly
idiotic manner with a fountain of silver dollars which
spouted out of the stone hearth of the dining room and
filled the whole house.</p>

<p class='c002'>He awoke when the first beams of the morning sun
streamed through the open window and slanted across
the bed. He was on the floor in a twinkling, dragging
the blankets off Brad and causing the Texan to awake
with a grunt and a shiver.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come out and take a plunge,” Dick invited him.
“It’ll clear the cobwebs out of your brains.”</p>

<p class='c002'>To tell the truth, he felt more need of that process
than did his chum; for his cogitating of the night before
had brought no satisfactory solution to the problem
which was perplexing him, and he was in quite as
much of a quandary as ever regarding the stand he
sought to take.</p>

<p class='c002'>“B-r-r!” chattered Buckhart. “I reckon I might as
well, pard. I couldn’t be much colder than I am now.
Come on.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Slipping off his pajamas, he snatched up a blanket,
and, wrapping it around him, started downstairs.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick lingered long enough to arouse the others, and
then followed. Together they raced across the grass,
silvery with hoar frost, and, without a pause, dashed
into the icy water.</p>

<p class='c002'>Both of them let out a yell which raised weird
echoes from across the silent lake, and then settled
down to a brisk swim. Presently the other three fellows
appeared and took the plunge with even more
vociferousness, and five minutes later they all trooped
back to the house, glowing from head to foot and feeling
ready for anything which the day had to offer.</p>

<p class='c002'>Joblots, dragging on his clothes with shivering haste,
chattering teeth and fumbling fingers, was horror-stricken
when he found out what they had been doing.</p>

<p class='c002'>“My grathiouth thaketh!” he gasped. “How could
you do it? I thould have perithed of the cold. My
conthtitution would never thtand the thtrain.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Brad slapped him on the back with a powerful hand
which caused Percy to wince and step back.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Do you good, kiddo!” he grinned. “We’re warm
as toast now, and you’re blue with the cold. Better
try it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, thankth,” Joblots returned hastily. “I’ll be all
wight ath thoon ath I get my clotheth on.”</p>

<p class='c002'>When the Yale men got downstairs they found him
trying to crawl into the chimney, while Jellison had
departed to the woodshed for material with which to
build up the fire.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick had decided to take no steps in any direction
regarding his discovery of the night before. A little
delay would do no harm and might be productive of
infinite good. The money was safe enough for the
present, now that he knew it was there, and while he
hustled around getting breakfast ready he kept a keen
watch on McCormick.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was no mistaking the fact that Archie had
something on his mind. Always light-hearted and
prompt to join in with any joshing or bantering give-and-take
which might be going on, he seemed decidedly
serious as he helped Dick with the breakfast. More
than once Merriwell caught him gazing absently out
of the window, and once when he spoke to him suddenly
the fellow gave a sudden start and the dish he
was holding slipped from his hands and crashed in
pieces on the floor.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t know what’s the matter with me,” he said
regretfully as he stooped to pick up the pieces. “I
didn’t sleep very well last night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What was the trouble?” Dick asked carelessly.
“Didn’t you feel well?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, yes, I felt all right. Strange bed, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You didn’t happen to get up, did you?” Merriwell
inquired, as he broke an egg into the frying pan.</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick gave a slight start and darted a keen
look at Dick, but the latter’s countenance was as free
from guile as that of a child-in-arms.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Did you hear any one?” Archie countered evasively.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I awoke some time during the night and thought
I heard some one walking around downstairs,” Dick
explained easily.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I did get up and go down,” McCormick said, after
a moment’s hesitation. “I was restless and finally got
up and took a walk through the rooms down there.
It was plagued cold, too, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell did not ask any more questions. He
had given Archie plenty of opportunity to explain
what had taken him down to the dining room if the
fellow were so inclined, but apparently he did not propose
to do any explaining.</p>

<p class='c002'>Despite McCormick’s absent state of mind and Merriwell’s
preoccupation, breakfast proved to be a jovial
meal. Fitzgerald was quite lively enough to keep
things going, and Buckhart and Baxter were good
seconds. Even Percy Joblots, now that he was warm
again, piped up now and then with some foolish remark
which sent them all into roars of laughter, while
Jellison seemed to have recovered from his grouch of
the night before and was absolutely genial.</p>

<p class='c002'>Neither of the two strangers, however, made any
mention of leaving the farmhouse that morning. They
could not decently stay there much longer, and Dick
rather expected them to announce their departure directly
breakfast was over. But they did not.</p>

<p class='c002'>Instead, Jellison took a comfortable seat in front of
the fire in the dining room, and, opening a newspaper,
which he had brought with him the night before, became
instantly absorbed in its contents. Joblots hung
around the kitchen while the dishes were being washed,
fluttering helplessly about, but really accomplishing
nothing.</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick evidently had something he wanted to
say to Dick, but seemed to find rather difficult. Several
times he started a remark, only to break off
abruptly; but at last, when he was drying the last
plate, he made the break.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t believe I’ll go out with you fellows this
morning,” he said, in a low tone. “I’ve got to go to
Middleberry for something special. I’ll be back by
noon, though, and perhaps I may run across Barry
somewhere. I can’t imagine what’s become of him.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick did not reply at once. He wondered what this
unexpected move could mean. What sudden business
could take Archie to Middleberry? However, he
could think of no plausible objection, and so long as
the money remained safely under the hearth McCormick
was not likely to stay away permanently.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just as you please, Mac,” he said quietly. “You’ll
miss some good sport, though. The first day may be
the best. I don’t want you to feel that you’re in the
way, or that we don’t want you, simply because you
didn’t start out with our party.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, no, it isn’t that,” Archie returned promptly.
“It’s just something which I have got to attend to this
morning. I’m sure I’ll be able to get back by lunch
time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, if you don’t find us here, you’ll have to trace
us by the guns,” Dick remarked, drying his hands.
“We’ll take some sandwiches with us and probably
won’t come back until night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>A sudden, worried look flashed into McCormick’s
face. He glanced swiftly through the open door at
Jellison, who sat reading before the fire. Then his
eyes returned to Dick’s face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Dick,” he whispered softly, “take him along with
you, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>He made a quick, almost imperceptible motion of his
head toward the other room.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell’s eyes narrowed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Jellison?” he asked in the same low tone.</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes. Don’t let him stay in the house alone. Give
him my gun, if you want to. I can’t tell you just now
why I ask this, but it’s very important to me.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But he’ll be leaving this morning,” Dick objected.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, he won’t,” McCormick returned positively.
“You mark my words, he’ll ask if he can’t stay through
the day. Tell him yes, and ask him to go out with you.
Will you do this much for me, Dick?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell looked keenly at the face of the man before
him, and Archie returned his gaze steadfastly.
His eyes were anxious and pleading, but Dick could
see no signs of guilt in them. Either the fellow was
innocent, or he had amazing powers of dissimulation.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why can’t you confide in me, Mac?” Merriwell
asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie looked distressed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’d like to, but I can’t—now,” he said, in a low
tone. “Won’t you take me on faith?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll have to, I reckon, Mac,” he returned. “All
right. I’ll do my best to help you out.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He walked into the other room where the Yale men
were busily engaged in putting together their guns,
filling cartridge belts with shells, and making general
preparations for the day’s sport. Joblots stood watching
them, a look of awed admiration on his face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“My grathiouth!” he exclaimed. “I with I could
do that ath quick ath you do. It taketh me about an
hour to fixth my gun wight.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald grinned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I guess you haven’t had much practice with a gun,
have you?” he inquired slyly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not much,” Joblots returned sadly. “I with I
wath going with you thith morning. I’d learn a lot.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Mac’s got to go in to the village,” Dick announced.
“Anybody want him to get anything?”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a general negative, and Dick turned to
Joblots.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Perhaps you’d like to stay with us this morning
and shoot?” he suggested pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c002'>His tone was quite casual, but he had a distinct object
in giving the invitation.</p>

<p class='c002'>The dapper little fellow seemed suddenly to experience
a change of heart.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thank you very much,” he returned hastily, “but
I think I’d better not thtay. I’d better be getting back,
and it will be pleathanter having thome one to go
with.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just as you please,” Dick said carelessly.</p>

<p class='c002'>But he turned away with a feeling of distinct satisfaction.
He had found out what he wanted to know.
Joblots was evidently determined not to let McCormick
out of his sight. And now arose the question: Why
was he following Archie? Dick’s thoughts were suddenly
broken in upon by Andrew Jellison.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Perhaps, since Mr. Joblots doesn’t wish to shoot,”
he said, in the pleasantest tone of voice, “you wouldn’t
mind if I took his place for the morning. I am very
fond of shooting, and I don’t suppose you will object
to my staying here until this afternoon when I can
start back in time to get the last train to the city?”</p>

<p class='c002'>So Archie was right. Jellison did want to stay,
after all.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No objection whatever,” Merriwell returned. “You
can take McCormick’s gun, for he won’t use it till
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thanks very much,” Jellison said. “You are most
kind. Now my little holiday will not be spoiled after
all.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without further delay, Archie departed, striding
across the field toward the woods with Joblots trotting
after him, taking short, quick, mincing steps which set
Fitzgerald off into a paroxysm of laughter. He at
once pranced across the room in a very lifelike imitation
of the dapper little fellow, but the exhibition came
to an untimely end when he stumbled over one of the
spreading claw feet of the mahagony table and nearly
fell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Drat the thing!” he exclaimed crossly. “What in
thunder does any one want to have table legs all over
the room for?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Peace, brother!” droned a sanctimonious voice
from the doorway. “Blessed is he who speaks from
a pure heart, but the curser and reviler is an abomination.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitz gave a gasp and whirled round, while the other
fellows looked up in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c002'>Standing on the threshold was a most extraordinary
figure of a man. He was very tall and very thin, his
lank garments of rusty black clinging to his skinny
frame in a manner that gave him a ludicrous resemblance
to a scarecrow. His face was long and pointed
like a razor edge. His hooked nose curved over his
thin-lipped mouth like the beak of a bird, and was of a
distinctly fiery hue, especially toward the end. His
long hair straggled down from under the broken brim
of an ancient silk hat which had weathered the storms
of many winters. His eyes were rolled piously upward
so that little but the whites could be seen, while both
hands were clasped over the handle of a grayish-green
umbrella of extraordinary size.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Yale men gazed at him for a moment in petrified
silence.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, who are you?” Fitzgerald inquired presently,
in a choking voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>The strange man slowly withdrew his eyes from the
ceiling and looked at the little fellow disapprovingly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“A rebuker of iniquity,” he returned ponderously,
“moved by a direct intervention of providence to bring
you to a full perception of the error of your ways.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Humph!” snorted Fitz. “I like your cheek.
What’s the matter with my ways, I’d like to know?
They suit me all right.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Confirmed in sin,” murmured the stranger. “Wallowing
in profanity. A sad case—very sad.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Buckhart chuckled gleefully.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Ah-ha, Fitzy!” he grinned. “I knew you’d sure
be pinched some day with your thundering cussing.”</p>

<p class='c002'>A look of pain came into the face of the tall man
and he lifted one thin hand reprovingly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hush, I beg of you,” he said severely. “First
search out your own heart and find whether it be
clean before you venture to reprove a brother.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald chortled joyfully.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s right!” he exclaimed. “Go for him, old
duck. Pick out your own beams, you Texas steer, before
you go hunting for my moats.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Though the man’s appearance and manner were
amusing enough, Dick wanted to get started with the
guns, and he felt that time was being wasted.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Might I ask who you are?” he inquired, struggling
to repress a smile, “and what your business here is?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The stranger glanced at him critically.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You may, sir,” he returned at length. “I am
pleased to observe that you do not appear to be steeped
in sin. At least, your language is not sprinkled with
the oaths which have cut my sensitive nature to the
quick. I am the Reverend Jeremy Pennyfeather, a
preacher and expounder of the Word. On my morning
ramble through the clean, sweet, dewy world, I
chanced to pass this house, and finding the door ajar, I
entered, seeking a moment’s rest, and, perhaps—er—a
little—er—sustenance, without which these poor carnal
bodies of ours cannot uphold the burdens of life.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick gazed at him in astonishment. He certainly
did not speak as if he were quite right in the head.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Your morning ramble?” he repeated. “You live
somewhere near here?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Reverend Pennyfeather hesitated.</p>

<p class='c002'>“At the moment I am without a—er—fixed charge,”
he explained. “I travel about carrying the Word and
doing what little good I can by the way. It sometimes
happens, as in the present instance, that I am temporarily
without a roof over my head or—only for
the moment, I assure you—the necessary fuel to keep
this poor machine of mine—er—going.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick’s face cleared. The fellow was some wandering
preacher, possibly crack-brained, and apparently
little better than a tramp. He had simply come in
there for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, I see,” he said quickly. “You want something
to eat. Just come out to the kitchen, will you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The man followed him slowly, with majestic steps,
but there was no mistaking the hungry glitter in his
eyes or the suppressed eagerness with which he fell
to on the simple fare which Dick laid before him. He
certainly ate as if he were half starved, and Merriwell
was far from regretting the time wasted in waiting
until he had finished.</p>

<p class='c002'>When there was nothing more left in sight, Pennyfeather
arose with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Young man, I thank you,” he said sonorously.
“Has it ever occurred to you what a degrading thing
it is that these frail bodies of ours cannot long exist
without carnal food?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I can’t say it has,” he returned promptly. “I have
a decided partiality to good things to eat, especially
when I come in after a day’s tramp through the woods,
with an appetite like a horse.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But what a shame it is that our soaring, ethereal
spirits should be tied to earth by such carnal bonds,”
persisted the preacher. “Were it not for the baleful
necessity of food and drink what might not man accomplish!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He rolled his eyes in ecstasy and then slowly lowered
them to Merriwell’s face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“A painful affliction which I have carried uncomplainingly
from the cradle of childhood, compels occasional
recourse to—er—stimulant,” he said blandly.
“Periods of faintness, you know, from which nothing
else seems to revive me. If, by any chance, you
have something of the sort at hand——”</p>

<p class='c002'>The pause was expressive. Dick glanced swiftly
at the thin man’s hushed nose. It would seem that
the periods of faintness had been more or less frequent.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sorry,” he said shortly, “but I haven’t.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Reverend Pennyfeather sighed and clasped his
hands together resignedly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Ah, well, perhaps ’tis better so,” he murmured.
“No doubt I shall get along without it. So far none
of the attacks have been fatal. Perhaps you have
no objection to my resting for a while before I resume
my way.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick had a very decided objection. Enough time
had been wasted already with this humbug.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You can take a chair out on the porch and sit there
as long as you please,” he said shortly. “We are just
leaving the house for the morning, however, and I
want to lock up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“That will do very nicely,” returned Pennyfeather
quickly. “I hope, however, you will allow me a scant
five minutes in which to bring to a realizing sense of
the evil of their ways, the two very profane young
men whom I first talked with.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He moved swiftly through the dining room as he
spoke, with Merriwell at his heels, but when they
reached the sitting room, it was found to be quite deserted.
Evidently the fellows, scenting a probable
continuance of the stranger’s moral lecture, had decamped.</p>

<p class='c002'>“The wicked flee when no man pursueth,” breathed
Pennyfeather. “What is so tormenting as a guilty
conscience, my dear sir? I should have liked one more
chance to plead with them, but life is full of disappointments,
which are always discipline for the soul,
sir—discipline for the soul. This chair will do nicely.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His sudden change of subject was due to a glimpse
of Dick’s impatient face as he stood significantly by
the door, gun in one hand, ready to be gone.</p>

<p class='c002'>With a swift judgment which had little of the spiritual
in it, the preacher picked instantly the most comfortable
chair in the room, and proceeded to roll it out
to the veranda with considerable expedition. Dick
closed and locked the door behind him, thrusting the
key into his pocket.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Rest yourself as long as you please,” he said briefly,
leaping to the ground. “Nobody will disturb you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without waiting for a reply, he started across the
open at a brisk pace to join the fellows who were
waiting for him at the edge of the woods.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Blessed is he who sits on a tack, for he shall rise
again,” intoned Fitzgerald, rolling his eyes heavenward
and drawing down the corners of his mouth.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Did he start in to give you a jawing, too, pard?”
Buckhart inquired, with a grin. “Hope you didn’t
say ‘dash it’ in his highness’ presence.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s he doing in that chair on the porch?” Teddy
Baxter asked curiously.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Resting,” Dick explained. “He’s subject to spells
of faintness which need—er—stimulant. Painful affliction
from childhood, you know. Nothing else
helps. When he found there was nothing doing in that
line, he asked for a chair upon which to rest his
weary limbs and recover from said spell, so I let him
take it. He can’t get away with that. It weighs about
a ton.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Dotty, isn’t he?” Fitz asked, as he leaped down
from the fence rail.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I guess so,” Dick returned. “Either that, or just
plain faker. Come on, let’s get busy. We’ve wasted
enough time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Leaping the fence, they at once plunged into the
woods and started in a northerly direction toward the
wilder, rocky country beyond, where Farmer Cobmore
had told them the partridges were remarkably
thick this fall. Already they were planning to get
up with the dawn next morning and try for wild ducks
at their feeding ground at the upper end of Cranberry
Lake.</p>

<p class='c002'>Andrew Jellison, carrying McCormick’s gun, seemed
to be thoroughly enjoying himself. He was pleasant
and genial, entering into the conversation now and
then in a perfectly natural way, while not thrusting
himself forward too much, and was, in short, so
totally different in every way from what he had been—ill-tempered
and overbearing of manner—the night
before, that he scarcely seemed the same man.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was almost as if a great load had been removed
from his mind and the reaction made him as light-hearted
and free from care as a boy. Merriwell wondered
at the change. Perhaps he had misjudged the
man when he credited him with an ulterior motive
in intruding upon them. Possibly the man’s nerves
really had been worn to a shred and he had wanted
nothing more than a little while in the peaceful quiet
of the wilderness to brace him up.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was no question of his ability to handle a
gun, nor of his interest and enthusiasm in the pursuit
of game. To him belonged the credit of the first
bird bagged, and throughout the morning he kept up
to the good record he made at the beginning.</p>

<p class='c002'>For a time they all kept pretty well together. Then,
little by little, they split up, each man taking the route
which he thought most favorable, having planned to
meet at a certain point about twelve o’clock for lunch.</p>

<p class='c002'>About eleven Dick started up a covey of birds and
became so interested in their pursuit that he forgot
all about the time and was consequently late reaching
the point of meeting.</p>

<p class='c002'>When he came out of the bushes to the broad, rocky
spur of the low mountain, he found the others seated
near at hand busily engaged in devouring sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Better hustle, Richard, if you want anything,” Fitzgerald
admonished, rather indistinctly. “We were so
hungry we couldn’t wait another minute.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell came forward and dropped down on the
rock.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How many?” Buckhart asked.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nine,” returned his chum.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great! That beats the record so far.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Where’s Jellison?” Dick asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had been conscious of something or some one
missing ever since he came out of the thicket.</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Search me,” he returned airily. “Haven’t seen
him since we split up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a little furrow of anxiety on Dick’s brow.
He was thinking of McCormick’s very evident worry
lest Jellison be left alone in the house. The fellow
had come with them that morning quite of his own
accord, but that did not prevent his hurrying back
there as soon as he could do so without attracting
attention. What had Mac to fear from him, anyway?
Was it possible that the man knew what lay under
the hearth?</p>

<p class='c002'>As Dick puzzled over the problem, all his doubts and
fears and perplexities returned in full force, and did
not add in the least to his pleasure in their little outing.</p>
<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>NOT A MOMENT TOO SOON.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>As Archie McCormick struck out along the forest
path which led to Lysander Cobmore’s farm he was
not especially pleased to have Percy Joblots tagging
along behind. He would much rather have been alone.
There was so much to think of and plan out that he
would have liked to be able to give his whole mind to
it instead of having to think of this little whipper-snapper
who, from the first, seemed to have considerable
difficulty in keeping up with the Yale man’s long
stride.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You mutht be in an awful hurry,” he panted, after
they had gone about half a mile.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I am,” snapped McCormick, without looking back.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was silence for a few moments, broken only
by the labored breathing of Percy.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Grathiouth thaketh!” he gasped presently. “I’m
motht dead. Couldn’t you walk a little thlower for
jutlit a few minuteth?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Growling an irritated response, Archie slowed down
a little, but very soon was back at the old speed. He
really did not intend to hustle so, but his mind was so
wholly given over to the problem which he had to solve
that, unconsciously, he almost flew over the rough
path.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Merthy!” moaned Joblots, mopping his face with
a delicate linen handkerchief. “Thith ith awful!”</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick did not hear him, so preoccupied was
he, and the dapper little fellow struggled on for a
quarter of a mile farther in panting silence.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Can’t we retht for jutht a minute?” he begged, at
the end of that time.</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie whirled around swiftly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why the dickens do you want to rest?” he demanded
fiercely. “I didn’t ask you to come with me!
I’ve got to get to Middleberry as quick as I possibly
can, and here you drag along and talk about wanting
to rest. Gee! It’s enough to try the patience of a
saint.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Joblots shrank back and instinctively put up a defensive
arm. Apparently he was afraid Mac was going
to hit him, and the look of fear on his puny, insignificant
face brought the big Yale man swiftly to his
senses.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Don’t be a fool!” he growled, in an apologetic tone.
“You don’t think I’d hit you, I hope? I suppose I
was a bit sharp, but you mustn’t mind what I said. I’m
worried clean out of my head, almost, about something.
We’ll rest a little and then take it slower.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Joblots instantly plucked up heart at this and became
all smiles. They stopped for a few minutes and
then went on again at moderate speed, and all the way
through the woods he drove McCormick almost wild
with his well-meant, but perfectly idiotic, chatter.</p>

<p class='c002'>At last, to McCormick’s infinite relief, the farmhouse
was in sight.</p>

<p class='c002'>Cobmore was at home, and, after a little persuasion,
was induced to let Archie borrow a horse and buggy to
take him in to town.</p>

<p class='c002'>He seemed to be a little curious as to the reason
for the trip, but the Yale man was not communicative,
so the farmer was obliged to content himself
with sly twitting of Joblots, who appeared to be absolutely
oblivious to his banter.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was a little after eight when they left Cobmore’s.
At half-past nine McCormick drove recklessly through
the long village street, and, pulling up with a jerk
in front of the small station building, leaped out and
ran inside, leaving Joblots staring in dismay at the
reins which had been tossed into his lap, as if he hadn’t
the least idea what he was to do with them.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently he laid them cautiously on the seat and
slipped quietly out of the buggy. Luckily one of the
natives lounging by the door, took it upon himself
to tie the horse to a hitching post, or there is no telling
how McCormick would have managed to return
the rig intact.</p>

<p class='c002'>Percy Joblots, safe from the perilous position alone
in the buggy, drew a quick breath and hastily followed
Archie into the building. He found him at the window
in the act of handing a telegraph message to the
station agent, but the latter had read it aloud to verify
it so quickly that it was all over before the dapper little
fellow could sidle quietly within hearing distance.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Will you please send it off at once?” McCormick
asked, handing the man a dollar bill. “Just keep the
change for your trouble.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellow’s eyes brightened instantly, and he lost
much of his languid, indifferent manner.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, sir,” he returned promptly. “If I can get an
open wire, I’ll push it right along.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He dropped down in his chair and the sharp click-click
of the instrument sounded through the office.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s all right,” the man said, as he looked up. “She’s
gone.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“How long will it take for an answer to come back?”
McCormick asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“All depends. Couple of hours, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Yale man frowned. Two hours seemed a long
time to wait, but there was no help for it. As he
turned away from the window, his eyes fell upon the
dapper Joblots standing quietly beside him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Humph!” he exclaimed in surprise. “What are
you doing here? Where’d you leave the horse?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Percy gasped.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thaketh alive! Outthide, of courthe. You
thouldn’t have left me alone with him. I never could
thand hortheth.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Idiot!” growled McCormick, rushing to the door.</p>

<p class='c002'>He gave an exclamation of relief as he saw the animal
safely tied, and then turned back to Joblots.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’ve got about an hour to wait for your train,”
he said shortly. “I’m going for a walk, so I’ll say
good-by to you now.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The little fellow seemed reluctant to part company
with the Yale man, but Archie had reached the point
when very little more of the other’s company would
drive him distracted, so he made short work of the
parting and hurried out of the station to the street
and thence for a tramp along the country road.</p>

<p class='c002'>His astonishment can better be imagined than described
when, returning a couple of hours later, the
first thing which greeted his eyes as he pushed open the
station door was the familiar form of the little pest
he fancied he was rid of for good, sitting complacently
on one of the benches.</p>

<p class='c002'>Joblots smiled quite happily into the frowning countenance
of the Yale man.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Tho glad you’re back,” he lisped. “Motht annoying
thing! I actually mithed the beathtly train. I
went acroth the stweet to thee if I couldn’t find thome
thigaretth, and while I wath talking to the man—motht
amuthing perthon, he wath—the bally thing came in
and I never thaw it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I never heard of such a fool trick!” snapped McCormick.
“Now you’ve got to wait till after one.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yeth,” Percy sighed, “and not a thingle plathe to
get a bite to eat.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, that’s your fault,” Archie said callously.
“You’ll have to go without.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Walking over to the window, he found that the
answer to his message had not yet arrived. Consequently
he had to put in another half hour in listening
to Percy’s idiotic prattle before the agent called
to him that the telegram had come.</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick sprang up eagerly and snatched the
yellow sheet from the man’s hand. His eyes eagerly
scanned the contents of the rather long communication
and, when he had read it all, they lighted up joyfully.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I was right,” he muttered under his breath. “I
knew it must be so. Now if I can only work it right.
Gee! I can hardly wait to get back to the house.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He hurried to the door, calling a brief good-by to
Percy as he passed that amazed person, leaped into
the buggy outside, and a moment later the clatter of
the flying horse’s hoofs died away down the village
street.</p>

<p class='c002'>He made good time back to Cobmore’s, drove the
horse into the stable and left him to the care of the
hired man. Then he darted into the woods, found the
path and fairly flew along it.</p>

<p class='c002'>His face was flushed and his eyes shining with eagerness
as he hurried along. Everything was coming his
way now, if he only used a few precautions.</p>

<p class='c002'>As he came out of the woods within sight of the
farmhouse, he stopped abruptly and looked sharply at
the building.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Who in thunder’s that?” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c002'>Close against the side of the house, beside one of
the windows, was a man, tall, thin, and dressed in
frayed, black garments. His back was toward McCormick,
and he seemed to be intent on something
which he was watching through a crack in the closed
blind.</p>

<p class='c002'>As Archie watched him, not knowing quite what to
do, the fellow suddenly turned and saw him. The
next instant his flying coat tails were vanishing around
the corner of the house.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Must be a tramp,” the Yale man murmured uneasily.</p>

<p class='c002'>He did not like the thought of any one spying
around that house, particularly around that room.
There was entirely too much at stake.</p>

<p class='c002'>Crossing the field, he reached the front of the
house. The door was closed and apparently locked.
The big armchair on the veranda puzzled him for a
moment, but he swiftly forgot that and everything
else as his eyes fell on the partly open window near at
hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>He drew his breath sharply and his face paled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By heavens!” he exclaimed. “Somebody’s broken
in!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The next moment he was on the veranda and had
slipped through the window. A sound came from
the dining room on the other side of the hall which
made him stiffen like a hound on the scent.</p>

<p class='c002'>Three strides took him past the stairs and into the
sitting room. A second later he stood in the doorway
of the dining room. He was just in time.</p>

<p class='c002'>The slab had been removed from the hearth, and before
the opening knelt Andrew Jellison. Near him
was a large suit case, and he was busily engaged in
lifting the packages of bank notes from the hole and
stowing them away in the case. He was so absorbed
in what he was doing that he did not hear the soft approach
of the Yale man, nor see him pause in the
doorway.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Caught with the goods, Jellison!” McCormick said,
in a tone of triumph.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You pretty near turned the trick, but not quite.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Andrew Jellison jerked up his head swiftly and drew
his breath with a quick, sharp intake. His face turned
the color of chalk, the package of bank notes dropped
from his limp hand into the hole, and for an instant
he gazed at the Yale man with a kind of horror-stricken
fascination.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then he leaped to his feet.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Pretty clever, but not quite clever enough,” McCormick
went on. “You didn’t know I heard you
steal downstairs last night and followed you. You
didn’t see me standing behind this very door while you
opened up your hiding place to make sure the stolen
money was still there. But I was here, Jellison. I
watched you put that slab back and slip upstairs again.
I even waited a full half hour, though it was the
hardest thing I ever did, so that you might have time
to go to sleep, before I went to find what you had
hidden here. It must have worried you a lot, Jellison,
to have to leave it here two years and never
have a chance to see whether any one had found it or
not.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Yale man paused and gazed with brightly
gleaming eyes at the sullen face of the man before him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How do you think I felt, Jellison,” McCormick
went on swiftly, “when I saw the label on the wrappers
around those notes? The Metropolis Bank, of
New York, Harlem Branch. Your bank, Jellison,
and—my brother’s!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The black-browed man gave a sudden start, and a
look of amazed incredulity leaped into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, my brother’s,” Archie repeated. “You didn’t
know that I was a brother of the man you ruined and
sent to prison, did you? You didn’t know that I had
sworn to ferret out the man who was responsible for
his disgrace and bring him to justice, if it took all my
life. You played your cards cleverly. The evidence
you faked deceived even the judge who tried the case.
You didn’t neglect a single step to throw the blame
from your guilty shoulders to those of an innocent
man. I wonder if you’ve ever thought since then about
that life you ruined, that reputation you blackened beyond
repair. But, thank God, I’ve found you out! All
your devilish plotting has come to nothing. Jim will
be cleared, and you’ll have a taste of Sing Sing yourself.
I hope you’ll like it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick’s face was hard and relentless. He
loved his older brother better than any one else in
the world. The sight of Jim’s agony and disgrace had
made him suffer torments. The man’s life had been almost
ruined by the fiendish ingenuity of Andrew Jellison.</p>

<p class='c002'>Released from prison some six months before, Jim
McCormick had done his best to live a new life, but
the stigma of the ex-convict clung to him wherever
he went. No one would trust him. He drifted from
place to place, always dropping lower in the social
scale, until at last Dick Merriwell had found him and,
learning his story, sent him to his brother Frank, in
the hopes that the latter might do something toward
clearing his name and finding out the real criminal.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was small wonder, therefore, that Archie felt a
bitter, relentless hatred for the man before him and
was determined to mete out to him a full measure of
justice.</p>

<p class='c002'>Jellison seemed to read this in the clear, cold eyes of
the younger man. He was in a desperate position
from which there seemed no possible escape. Unconsciously
he drew one hand across his sweat-stained
forehead.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I suppose you wonder why I didn’t nab you this
morning,” Archie continued presently. “I wasn’t sure
of you. I didn’t know your first name nor what you
looked like. I couldn’t afford to make any mistake, so
I went to Middleberry and wired my brother for a
full description. It came all right, and I was the
happiest fellow alive.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The bank cashier moistened his dry lips.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I wonder you said nothing to your friends,” he
said, in a voice which held a ring of attempted bravado.
“They would have kept me here. How did you know
I wouldn’t get away before you came back?”</p>

<p class='c002'>His eyes glittered strangely as he watched the Yale
man with an eager, furtive look. Something more
than mere curiosity seemed to be beneath the question.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You wouldn’t leave without the coin,” Archie answered.
“There’s no way out of here but by the path
through the woods, and I was sure you couldn’t make
it before I got back from the village. Besides, I asked
Merriwell to get you out shooting with them this
morning so as to prevent your doing anything while
I was gone. I didn’t tell the boys about it because I
wanted to clear Jim myself. I didn’t want anybody
else to have a hand in it, and they haven’t. No one
else knows yet, Jellison; but they will mighty quick.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I think not!” snarled the older man ferociously.</p>

<p class='c002'>With a lightninglike motion of his arm, his right
hand slid into a hip pocket and flashed out again, gripping
a very serviceable-looking revolver.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I think not!” he repeated triumphantly.</p>

<p class='c002'>McCormick’s face paled a little as he gazed straight
into the steady barrel of the weapon. But, though
his face remained unmoved, his heart sank within him.
What an idiot he had been not to prepare for this!
Somehow, the idea that Jellison would be armed had
never entered his head. He was so much superior,
physically, to the older man that his ability to capture
him had seemed a thing beyond question.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You fool!” sneered Jellison. “Did you think I’d
let myself be pinched by a kid like you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie smiled rather wryly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I was careless, I admit,” he acknowledged. “But
I don’t see that you’re out of the woods yet. What
are you going to do about it, now that you have got
the drop on me?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Jellison did not answer at once. As he stood thinking,
a little of the triumph died out of his face and
his forehead crinkled with a network of worried
wrinkles.</p>

<p class='c002'>What was he going to do about it? He might get
away himself—might even carry off the money; but
would he get far? McCormick knew the truth, and,
though the cashier might tie him up long enough to
get a good start, the fellow would be released the instant
his friends came back from their shooting, and
the whole lot of them would be on his trail like a pack
of hounds.</p>

<p class='c002'>Even if he did manage to get out of the country,
what could he do then? The arm of the law was long.
It would reach out inexorably after him over land
and sea. He would be hounded from place to place,
never resting, never secure, always knowing that he
was followed, feeling sure that in the end tireless,
never sleeping justice would find him out.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was maddening. To think that all his carefully
laid plans should be thwarted by a mere boy! He had
waited so many weary months for this moment only
to have his triumph turn to dust and ashes in his
mouth. Everything had gone so smoothly, too, from
the very first. No one had suspected him for an instant.
He had played his cards too well. The only
stumbling block had been the sudden, unexpected turning
against him of old Hickey. That had worried him
intensely, but now Hickey was dead, and he had anticipated
no further difficulty. To have the whole
carefully reared edifice topple about his head like a
ruined house of cards nearly drove him mad.</p>

<p class='c002'>His mind flashed swiftly on into the future. He
saw the grip of the law closing about him inexorably.
He would be captured, tried, sentenced. He would be
a convict, walled into that hideous gray prison up the
river, known only by a number, forced to do menial
tasks.</p>

<p class='c002'>And what of his wife—the only human being in the
world that he cared for, besides himself. What would
she do? Cling to him? Help and comfort him, and
buoy up his broken spirits? Visit him in his cell and
wait faithfully for his release? No! Marion was not
that sort. She would be furiously angry—hysterical,
no doubt. She would bitterly bewail the moment when
she first set eyes on him. Her love for him would
turn to hate, and he would never see her again.</p>

<p class='c002'>He writhed inwardly at the thought. He could not
stand it—he would not. He glared ferociously at McCormick.
But for this fool who had accidentally
stumbled upon his secret he would be safe. No one
would suspect in a thousand years.</p>

<p class='c002'>A sudden thought came into his mind, making even
his callous nature shrink. He thrust it from him, but
it returned again and again, whispering insidiously
that it was the only way out.</p>

<p class='c002'>He stole a stealthy glance at the youth before him.
It would be possible. Only one life stood between
him and utter ruin. He had an instinctive horror of
staining his hands with blood, but what other course
was there left him? With this fellow out of the way,
he could hold up his head once more—could go his
way through the world, apparently without a stigma.</p>

<p class='c002'>It would be simple, too. He could manage it without
suspicion falling upon him, if he used ordinary
care. He had heard enough to know that McCormick
was not one of the original hunting party. The fellow
had gone to Middleberry that morning on an errand
which he had not explained to the others. If he did
not return, they would not be surprised. They would
think he had gone back to New Haven.</p>

<p class='c002'>It would be easy enough to get him into the woods.
He could force him to carry the suit case full of money.
That would be natural enough. The fellow would not
suspect any other motive. Jellison knew something of
the wide extent of the forest thereabouts. A body
might lie hidden there for years without any one
finding it.</p>

<p class='c002'>These and a hundred other thoughts flashed through
his mind as he stood there silent. Archie wondered
what the fellow was thinking about which kept him
quiet so long. He was curious to know what step the
man proposed taking to escape from the web in which
he was involved.</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly Jellison seemed to have made up his mind.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Put the rest of those bills in the suit case,” he
commanded, with a threatening motion of his revolver.</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie hesitated an instant.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Do what I tell you!” snapped Jellison. “I’m a desperate
man, and I won’t answer for the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Then McCormick obeyed him. He could not see
just what the fellow was going to do. There was no
chance at all for him to escape entirely. Dropping
down on the floor, he hastily crammed the rest of the
bank notes into the bag and then closed and locked it.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Now take it up and walk ahead of me,” Jellison
said, in an icy voice. “You’ve been so smart butting
into my game that I’m going to get a little use out
of you. March!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE END OF THE GAME.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Having finished lunch and lounged on the rocks for
a little while, the four Yale men set out toward the
lower fields and thickets in search of quail.</p>

<p class='c002'>As before, they did not keep together long. Each
one had his own ideas as to where the birds were to
be found, so presently they broke up and continued on
their way alone.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell did not get much pleasure out of it, however.
The day was perfect, the birds fairly abundant,
but his mind persisted in flying back to the farmhouse
and the mystery it contained, decidedly to the detriment
of his gunning.</p>

<p class='c002'>He kept wondering whether Jellison had returned to
the house, and, if so, what he was doing there. Did
Jellison know of the money under the hearth? What
had taken Mac to the village?</p>

<p class='c002'>He was so preoccupied with all these questions that
he made a number of wretched misses, and at last he
broke his gun with a snap and slipped out the shells.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s about all for to-day,” he grumbled. “I
can’t do a thing with this on my mind. I’m going
back.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Now that he had at last come to this decision, he
wished he had done so long ago. There was no telling
what might be going on in the house by the lake.
He was a fool to have come out at all and left the
treasure unguarded.</p>

<p class='c002'>As he tore his way through the tangle of briars and
undergrowth it seemed as if the very bushes were
trying to hinder his progress. He could not get along
fast enough, and the result was that when he emerged
into the more open forest back of the house he was
a mass of cuts and scratches and his hands were full
of thorns.</p>

<p class='c002'>He did not stop for that, however, but kept on his
way through the trees at a dogtrot. The woods were
pleasantly free from undergrowth, and underfoot the
soft, springy moss carpeted the ground as far as the
eye could reach and made his progress almost noiseless.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had almost reached the cleared ground about
the house—had just caught a glimpse of the bright
sky line ahead, in fact—when he made out the figure
of a man slipping through the trees in front of him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Who the mischief is that?” he muttered, with a
perplexed frown.</p>

<p class='c002'>It looked a little like Joblots, but he supposed that
the dapper little fellow was by this time hundreds of
miles away. At any rate, he was determined to find
out, and, quickening his pace, he rapidly and noiselessly
approached the fellow, whose back was toward
him.</p>

<p class='c002'>A moment later he saw that it was Joblots. There
was no mistaking the shape of the little fellow’s back
and head, and certainly there could be no duplicate
hereabouts of that giddy, gaudy, shiny, new khaki
shooting rig.</p>

<p class='c002'>Percy evidently had some very definite object in
view. He did not loiter as one enjoying the beauties
of the forest, but pressed steadily forward toward the
line of clearing, darting keen glances to right and
left in a manner which was not at all like the absurd
little creature they had come upon the day before.
Moreover, his gun was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='c002'>As he approached, swiftly and noiselessly, a conviction
that this time he was watching the real man,
came upon Dick with overwhelming force. The next
moment, as he reached Joblots’ side and caught his
arm, he was sure. The expression on the fellow’s face,
startled and annoyed, but not in the least idiotic, was
proof positive.</p>

<p class='c002'>The next instant a mask fell over the small man’s
countenance.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Grathiouth thaketh!” he gasped. “How you thurprithed——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Cut that!” Dick broke in sharply. “That went last
night, but there’s no use in trying to fool me now.
Who are you? and what are you after here?”</p>

<p class='c002'>A bewildered look came into the pale-blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I weally don’t know what——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Cut it, I say!” Merriwell repeated, his eyes flashing.
“Spit out the truth or I’ll knock it out of you!
Quick, now! Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>A slowly dawning expression of keen shrewdness
came over the other’s face, and for an instant he eyed
Dick coolly and appraisingly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re no fool, are you?” he said at length, in a
totally different voice. “I reckon you’ve got me
straight this time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He hesitated for an instant.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Reckon I’ll have to trust you,” he went on quickly.
“I’m after the guys who cracked the Hartford bank.
Now, the question is, are you going to help me or try
to trip me up?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick’s chin squared and his eyes narrowed as the
thought of Archie flashed into his mind. It was incredible—impossible.
He would not believe.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Who are you after?” he asked at length.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That feller McCormick,” returned the detective
quickly. “He was seen around the bank just before
the robbery. Him an’ his two pals took the train out
in the morning. At Milton they separated. He come
here with the swag, an’ the other two went on. My
partner is following them.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What makes you think McCormick has the swag?”
Dick asked, though his heart was cold within him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t think; I know,” the man answered. “He
brought it in a big bag, and last night he hid it under
the hearth in the dining room. I heard him sneak
downstairs, and I slipped through the kitchen and
watched him. There ain’t no doubt about it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick did not speak. His heart was too full for
words. What he had tried not to believe was true.
All the time that he had been watching Mac through
the crack in the door the detective had been on the
lookout from the kitchen. In spite of all, he could
not seem to think of Archie as a thief. How had he
ever been roped into such a thing?</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, what are you going to do?” he inquired presently,
in a listless voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Pinch him,” returned the detective tersely. “I’ve
been holding off in hopes of getting his pals. Thought
he telegraphed ’em this morning, but he didn’t. The
agent wouldn’t tell me what was in the message he
sent, but I did find out that the reply came from
Bloomfield. It ain’t likely his pals are there. It’s too
far away.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick caught his breath suddenly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Bloomfield!” he exclaimed, and then was silent.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bloomfield was where his brother Frank’s school
was located. Just now Archie McCormick’s brother,
the one who had served a term in State’s prison, happened
also to be there. What did it all mean? Why
was Archie telegraphing to Jim? His thoughts were
suddenly broken in upon by the detective’s voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well,” he said briskly, “what are you going to do,
help me or hinder me?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Neither one or the other,” Merriwell said shortly.
“I can’t hinder you, and I certainly don’t propose to
help you arrest a friend of mine, especially when I
don’t believe he’s had anything to do with this robbery.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s all rot,” Joblots said quickly. “The thing’s
as good as proved. Well, I’ve got to get busy. There
ain’t no time to waste.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He started on toward the edge of the woods, Dick
following him listlessly. His mind absolutely refused
to credit the truth of the detective’s assertions, even
with the proof seemingly as unassailable as it was.
He would not believe that Archie was a thief. There
must be some other explanation of his peculiar actions.</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly Joblots, reaching the fringe of trees which
bordered the field, stopped short.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thunder!” he exclaimed. “Here he comes now
with the swag. Jellison, too. What do you think of
that! I never suspected Jellison.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Leaning over his shoulder, Merriwell saw that he
was right. Coming toward the woods from the
house were two men, walking in single file. The first
one, unmistakably Archie, carried a large dress suit
case under the weight of which he seemed barely able
to stagger. Behind him walked Andrew Jellison.
What did it mean? Was it possible that the two were
friends and partners in this crime? Had Archie deceived
him from the first?</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly his eyes narrowed and he drew a quick
breath. The next instant he was slipping back through
the trees and doubling toward the point where the path
entered the forest. Joblots caught up with him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You said you wouldn’t hinder,” he whispered
hoarsely. “You’re going to warn them.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m going to help you,” Dick snapped. “Are you
blind, man? Don’t you see what’s happened? Jellison
is forcing Mac to go with him. He’s driving him
along with a gun! Hush, now! Don’t make a sound.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Bewildered, incredulous, the detective followed Merriwell
closely. He could not believe what the Yale man
had said, but there was nothing else to do, except
follow in the other’s lead.</p>

<p class='c002'>In a moment they had reached the edge of the path
and crouched in the bushes. They were just in time.
Already the feet of the two men rustled in the leaves
near at hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How long are you going to keep up this farce?”
they heard McCormick say. “You certainly can’t expect
to force me to go on to Middleberry.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Never you mind!” snapped Jellison. “Shut your
face and do as I tell you!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The next instant Archie passed Dick’s hiding place,
staggering under the weight of the heavy bag. A
moment later Jellison appeared.</p>

<p class='c002'>Without a single preliminary sound, Merriwell’s
lithe body, launched from the thicket with a spring like
that of a panther, struck the cashier full on the back,
and the two crashed to the ground together. The
shock knocked the revolver from the fellow’s hand,
and, though he struggled hard, Dick had no difficulty
in holding him down. Then he looked about him.</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie had dropped the bag and was staring at the
tangle of arms and legs in a dazed fashion. As he
recognized Dick, he gave a shout of joy.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thank Heaven, you came in time, old fellow!” he
exclaimed. “I’ve been an awful fool. He was just
getting away with all the money.”</p>

<p class='c002'>A look of triumph appeared on Joblots’ face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Ah! ha!” he muttered. “What did I tell you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What money?” Dick demanded. “Quick, Archie!
What are you talking about?”</p>

<p class='c002'>His face was strained with the suspense of waiting.</p>

<p class='c002'>“The money he stole from the Metropolis Bank two
years ago,” McCormick answered eagerly. “He’s the
thief. He’s the one who sent Jim to prison. He hid
the money under the hearth, expecting to get it after
everything was safe, but old man Hickey wouldn’t
let him in. He came last night for it. I was awake and
heard him slip downstairs. I followed him and saw
him take up the stone to see if it was still there.
After he had gone, I looked myself. There’s no doubt
about it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Joblots listened with a growing expression of mortification
and chagrin.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yah!” he snapped. “I don’t believe it! You stole
that money from the Hartford bank two nights ago!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Archie looked at him in utter bewilderment. Then
his face darkened.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You fool!” he ripped out. “How dare you accuse
me of such a thing! Look and see. The wrappers are
still around the bills.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Scowling fiercely at Joblots, he kicked the bag with
one foot.</p>

<p class='c002'>In an instant the detective was on his knees, fumbling
with the catch. Then, as it yielded, he threw back
the cover and snatched up one of the packages. His
face was incredulous. Tossing down the packet he
picked up another, and yet another. They were all
the same. Presently he arose slowly to his feet.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By thunder!” he muttered. “Looks like there
was something in it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Then he looked keenly at Archie.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What were you doing around the bank in Hartford
at twelve o’clock the night of the robbery?” he asked
significantly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Coming home from a smoker,” the Yale man returned
quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How about those guys you were chummy with on
the train yesterday?” persisted Joblots.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Never saw them before in my life,” McCormick
smiled. “We got talking to each other in the train.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The detective looked nonplused. Before he had
time to think of any more questions, a sanctimonious
voice sounded from the path behind the little group.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Behold the wicked man who diggeth a pit and
falleth into it himself. Look’s as if you’d got him this
time, gents.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick loosened his grip on Jellison and sprang to his
feet. The ruddy face of the Reverend Jeremy Pennyfeather
grinned at him from a little distance. His
eyes were twinkling shrewdly, and he did not look quite
so pious as he had that morning.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well!” Dick remarked. “Are you another detective?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellow laughed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Guessed right the first crack, my friend,” he returned
easily. “I was sent out by Mr. Frank Merriwell
to keep watch of this here gent.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He indicated the sullen, lowering Jellison, who had
raised himself to a sitting posture.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Looks like you boys had saved me a lot of trouble.
Caught him with the goods, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, and I hope he gets the biggest penalty that
can be imposed,” he said sternly. “He’s pretty near
ruined one man’s life.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“There ain’t any doubt he’ll git all that’s coming to
him,” the lank fellow said, in a tone of satisfaction.
“We ought to be able to catch the last train down and
give him his first taste of jail to-night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“And I’ll go with you,” Archie said decidedly. “I
want to see him good and safe.”</p>

<p class='c002'>They all finally decided to go as far as Lysander
Cobmore’s place, from which Archie and the detective
could proceed alone with the guilty man. Making
their way quickly through the woods, they found the
farmer standing by the barn, a yellow envelope in his
hand. His eyes lit up as they fell upon the dapper
figure of Joblots.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Waal, waal,” he drawled. “If you ain’t saved me a
heap o’ trouble. This here telegram was jest brought
from town, and I hadn’t no more notion than a cat
what to do with it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He handed the envelope to the detective, who tore
it open eagerly. As he took in the contents, his face
darkened and he bit his lips angrily.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Two days wasted!” he snapped, crumpling the
message in his hand, and tossing it to the ground.
“Wouldn’t that frost you!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Reverend Pennyfeather made no bones about
picking it up, and, when he had spread it out, this was
what he read:</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hartford crooks nabbed at Westfield. Swag recovered.
You are on false trail. Report at office at
once.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>AS IN A LOOKING-GLASS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>The day was overcast and lowery. It was not actually
raining, but the raw wind from the Sound brought
with it a heavy mist, damp and clogging, which was
almost as bad. The crispness was taken out of everything,
the sidewalks were dank and slippery, and pedestrians
hurried along the streets with turned-up collars,
turned-down hat brims, and a general air of shivery
unpleasantness, as if they hated themselves, the people
they brushed elbows with, and, above all else, the business
which made it necessary for them to be out in
such sloppy weather.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick Merriwell, who had returned to New Haven,
was no exception to the general rule as he walked
along Chapel Street toward the campus. His long,
loose, tightly buttoned coat, with the collar turned above
the ears, was covered with a multitude of tiny drips
of moisture, almost like hoarfrost. The brim of his
soft felt hat was pulled down over his eyes, and now
and then a drop of water gathered at the point and
splashed to the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had been out on a rather important errand
and, being anxious to get over to the dining hall on
time, he did not dawdle, but strode along, gloved
hands deep down in his pockets, growling under his
breath maledictions on the weather which would effectually
prevent any football practice on the field that
afternoon.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was walking on the inside of the sidewalk, close
to the shop windows, and had almost reached the corner
of Temple Street when he collided violently with
a man who came dashing out of a store without a
glance to see where he was going.</p>

<p class='c002'>Both men staggered a little from the shock and the
stranger’s black derby was knocked off. It was rolling
toward the gutter when Dick caught it and turned to
restore it to its owner.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Beg pardon,” he said regretfully. “I had no
idea——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He stopped abruptly, his eyes widening with astonishment.
For a second he stared in bewilderment at
the young man before him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, I’ll be hanged!” he ejaculated.</p>

<p class='c002'>The other man looked scarcely less surprised.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Exactly!” he returned. “You took the very words
out of my mouth.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His keen, dark eyes were surveying Merriwell in
much the same way that the Yale man looked at him,
and his handsome face wore on it just such a look of
whimsical perplexity as distinguished Dick’s countenance.</p>

<p class='c002'>And smaller wonder. Had the two been twin
brothers they could scarcely have been more alike.
There was not a fraction of an inch variation in their
heights. Both were well set-up, broad-shouldered,
slim-hipped, with the lithe grace of carriage which distinguishes
the well-developed athlete. Both had dark
hair and equally dark eyes, straight noses, and well-shaped,
sensitive mouths.</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellow who had come out of the shop looked
a trifle older than the Yale senior, and there were a
number of minor points about his face and figure which
would be quite apparent to a close observer when the
two men were together; but, taken all in all, the resemblance
was quite close enough to warrant the surprise
which each one manifested at the sight of the
other.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell recovered his customary poise first.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It certainly does give a fellow a queer feeling to
run up against his double in this casual sort of way,”
he remarked lightly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Doesn’t it?” replied the stranger. “You don’t
happen to be some long-lost brother that I’ve never
heard of, do you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I doubt it,” he returned. “I never had but one,
and he looks less like me than you do. Perhaps somewhere
back in the dark ages our ancestors were the
same. My name is Merriwell, by the bye.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The other gave a sudden start and a look of chagrin
flashed over his face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Merriwell!” he exclaimed. “Dick Merriwell, of
Yale! Of course. If I wasn’t the thickest sort of a
blockhead that ever walked, I’d have caught on before.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Yale man looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It isn’t possible we’ve ever met before,” he said
quickly. “You’re not the sort of man I’d be likely to
forget in a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The stranger laughed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“We’ve never met, though I’ve tried to meet you a
number of times,” he laughed. “But I’ve seen you
more than once. I can’t think why I didn’t recognize
you at once. I suppose it’s because I’ve never had a
really good, close look at you before. It has always
been a long-distance glimpse from the bleachers or the
grand stand out on the athletic field, and you know how
football paraphernalia disguises a fellow.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By Jove! I’m glad I was Johnny-on-the-spot just
now, even if I did nearly knock you down. My name
is Austin Demarest, and I certainly am glad to meet
you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He held out a slim, brown hand with such an air of
pleasure and camaraderie that Merriwell could not help
a feeling of satisfaction as he clasped it in his own.</p>

<p class='c002'>“And I you, Mr. Demarest,” he returned quickly.
“I have a notion that I could like you a lot if I ever
had a chance. Perhaps that sounds rather conceited,
though.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sort of in the nature of self-praise, eh?” chuckled
Demarest. “It would be tough if a fellow couldn’t
get along pretty well with himself, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Unconsciously they had turned and were walking
slowly along Chapel Street. Each one seemed unable
to refrain from throwing occasional swift glances at
the other, as if to satisfy himself that the odd resemblance
was really a concrete fact and not some chance
figment of the imagination.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently their eyes met and both burst out laughing.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It doesn’t seem right,” chuckled Demarest. “I
can’t get used to looking at you as if I were gazing at
a mirror.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nor I,” Merriwell agreed. “What sport we could
have if you were only in the university. I can conjure
up all sorts of attractive possibilities.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Such as substitution in lecture rooms?” suggested
Demarest slyly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not so much that as the fun we could have outside,”
Dick answered. “By the way, what was the
reason you wanted to meet me so much?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest did not answer at once. His face clouded
and the laughter died out of his eyes. It was as if
the question had recalled to his mind something disagreeable
which had, for the moment, been forgotten.
Twice he glanced hesitatingly at Merriwell in a troubled,
doubtful sort of way as one who does not know
quite what course to pursue.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s a rather long story,” he said, at length; “and
yet I think I’d like to tell it, if you have time to listen.
Have you got anything on for a couple of hours?
Couldn’t you come in and lunch with me?”</p>

<p class='c002'>He made a quick gesture toward the New Haven
House, at the entrance to which they had stopped an
instant before.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, yes,” Dick returned readily, “I’ll be very
glad to. I was on my way to the dining hall, but
this will be much better.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest’s face cleared.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Good,” he said tersely. “I’m in the deuce of a
hole, and perhaps you can help me out of it. Even
if you can’t, there’s always a certain satisfaction in
pouring one’s woes into a sympathetic ear.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled as they entered the hotel lobby and
walked toward the cloakroom.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What makes you so sure my ear will be sympathetic?”
he asked. “You may get a terrible disappointment.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I guess not,” Demarest returned quickly. “We look
so much alike that the resemblance can’t possibly stop
at that. And I’m so blamed sorry for myself that
sometimes I could fairly weep at my own misfortunes.
Haven’t you felt sad sometimes without knowing
the reason why?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Once in a while, yes.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I knew it!” Demarest exclaimed. “Those were the
times when I was being more severely mauled by the
Goddess of Misfortune than usual. Sort of mental
telepathy, you know. But come, let’s not waste any
more precious minutes. I fairly pine to let loose the
floodgates of self-confession, and over there in the
corner I see an empty table which had been saved for
us by a special dispensation of providence.”</p>
<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>AUSTIN DEMAREST, ACTOR.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>As Dick settled down on one side of the cozy little
table near one of the windows and unfolded his napkin
he felt a pleasant glow of satisfaction stealing over
him. Short as was their acquaintance, he already felt
a distinct liking for the man opposite him, whose handsome
face still impressed him with the odd sensation
of looking into a mirror and seeing his own countenance
reflected there.</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellow was very evidently a gentleman by birth
and breeding. That had been plain from the first moment
of their unconventional meeting. His manners
were unexceptionable, and he had a certain air of
polished refinement which was manifest to Merriwell’s
keen perception in a dozen unobtrusive ways.</p>

<p class='c002'>But more than all else the Yale man was attracted
by the other’s manner of talking. Whimsical, half
bantering, almost careless, there was yet about it an
undercurrent of seriousness, which gave the barest
hint of the real man beneath that disguising mask
and made Dick eager for a more thorough knowledge
of the character which he felt would prove more interesting
by far than that of the majority of men.</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest picked up the card and ordered luncheon
with the swiftness and taste of a connoisseur. He
evidently had the rare art of selecting an attractive
meal without spending a half hour at it. Then, folding
his arms loosely, he leaned forward.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Let’s begin at the beginning,” he said with twinkling
eyes. “That sounds a little unnecessary, I know,
but so few people really do begin a story where they
ought. Probably you’ve noticed it, though. For instance,
I am strongly tempted to plunge headfirst into
the maelstrom of my troubles, and it is only by a
strong effort of will that I bring myself to begin where
I ought to lead you gradually thence to a consideration
of the worst.”</p>

<p class='c002'>While he was talking, Dick became conscious of
the remarkable beauty and purity of his voice. His
tones were rather low, and he spoke with just a hint
of the fascinating Southern drawl; but every syllable
was clear and distinct, and now and then there was a
sudden raising or lowering of the pitch which had a
distinctly dramatic effect. Merriwell found himself
thinking what an admirable actor the man would make,
if his histrionic ability only matched his voice. He was
consequently almost startled when Demarest went on:</p>

<p class='c002'>“Know, kind second self, that I am an actor. From
my earliest days I longed to tread the magic boards
and pour out my soul to vast applauding audiences
through the medium of our immortal dramatists. At
the age of twelve I had learned the parts of <i>Hamlet</i> and
<i>Brutus</i>. Can you fancy it? Two years later I had
built a puppet stage in the attic of our country home
and organized a company of which I was, of course,
the star. In times of need and scarcity of talent, I
have been known to play several parts in one performance.
The admission to those matchless performances
was, I recollect, a penny. You will perceive
that those were the good old days before the
trust came upon us and before the régime of the
ubiquitous ticket speculator.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled appreciatively. There was something
fascinating in the fellow’s whimsical, airy manner.</p>

<p class='c002'>“But why linger on those far-away times?” Demarest
went on quickly. “I only touch upon them that
you may see beyond peradventure that I was destined
for the stage. Sad to say, my esteemed family thought
otherwise. What was cute and cunning in a child became
mad folly—in their estimation—when I reached
the age of manhood and still persisted in my determination.
I haunted the theatre, breathing in the indescribable
atmosphere of the place as if it were the
nectar and ambrosia of the gods. Then my people
became seriously alarmed and packed me off to Cambridge.
At first I was in despair and planned to run
away, but in the end I stuck it out and I have always
been thankful. Unknown to my family, who thought
I was following the old-fashioned, stereotyped course,
I specialized in elocution, English literature, and the
modern languages, which have been of inestimable
service to me ever since.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He paused, as the waiter appeared with the first
course and deftly placed it before the two men. Dick
was much interested in the recital.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course you persisted in your determination to
go on the stage,” he said quickly. “I imagine you had
a rather strenuous time after you graduated.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest sighed and made an expressive gesture
with his shapely, brown hands.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Precisely,” he returned. “Over that let us draw a
veil. I won out in the end, but it was only by a display
of the utmost firmness. My father called it pigheadedness.
To this day they are not reconciled,
though I fancy they are beginning to be resigned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I took a course in the best dramatic school in New
York, and, when I left that, got a minor position in
the company of one of our leading actor dramatists.
It was the merest trifle. I think I had barely half a
dozen lines, but I was rejoiced, for it was a foothold.
I had reached the bottom rung of the ladder up which
I meant to climb to the very top. I worked hard.
Before the company left New York I had mastered
half a dozen rôles and was letter-perfect. I had a
fancy that I could not improve on several of them,
but my chance did not come until we were playing in
Chicago, where the leading juvenile was suddenly
seized with appendicitis. He had no understudy—happily
for me. I went at once to Mr. Manton and boldly
asked for the part. To my astonishment, almost without
word, he agreed to try me out at a rehearsal. I
found out afterward that he had been keeping an eye
on me ever since I entered the company. He was
the best friend I ever had.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He stopped, took a few sips of his bouillon, and
leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You made good?” Dick questioned eagerly. “But
of course you must have.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thanks to Mr. Manton, I did,” returned Demarest.
“He took infinite pains with me, as he always did
with any one he thought worth the trouble. I kept that
part for the remainder of the season, and the next fall
I had one almost as good, though of a totally different
sort. Then came my patron’s sudden death. It
was a terrible blow to me, quite apart from the fact
that I was thrown out of a job; for I had grown to be
amazingly fond of him. But I had little time for repining.
I had to find something to do and it did not
prove to be so easy as I had supposed. It was then
that I had my first experience with the so-called theatrical
trust, the members of which control many of
the companies and theatres, in this country.</p>

<p class='c002'>“At last I landed a job, but it was a good deal of a
come-down both in salary and importance. But even
under their auspices I kept on going slowly upward
until I reached a point which would have contented
most men. Perhaps it should have contented me, but
I knew I hadn’t reached the very top, and that I was
determined to do, or perish in the attempt.</p>

<p class='c002'>“About that time—which was last fall, to be explicit—I
suddenly decided to write a play. The germ
had been in my mind for a long period, but I lacked
the time to follow it out. Happily the company disbanded
earlier than usual last spring, and I at once
set to work on my pet idea. I succeeded even better
than I had hoped, for the play was good stuff and
the leading part a crackajack.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He paused and smiled at Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“This is the point where you step upon the stage,”
he went on. “It’s taken a long time to get there,
hasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick’s face was full of puzzled curiosity.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You are the hero of the play,” Demarest explained,
with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I?” gasped the Yale man. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The actor pushed aside his salad and rested one arm
lightly on the table.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s this way,” he said, in his low, musical voice.
“Though I had never met you, I had heard a lot about
you from mutual friends and had seen you more than
once on the diamond and gridiron. Consequently,
when I decided that the play should be one of college
life with the scene laid in New Haven, I felt that you
would make an admirable character for the leading
man. Of course, I ran you in under a different name,
but I took the liberty of using a good many of your
characteristics, and while I wrote I had you constantly
in mind. I hope you don’t object, for it was rather
cheeky.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell laughed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, no, I don’t mind; but I’m afraid you’ve
been stung. There’s nothing of the hero about me.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, modesty, thou rare and precious quality!”
murmured Demarest. “I’ve made a hero of you, then,
against your will. When you’ve read the play you will
see yourself in a different light. But I suppose by
this time you, are wondering where my troubles
come in.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“A little,” Dick confessed. “So far your career
seems to have been an unqualified success.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Listen, and you shall hear the dire story. Having
the play, it never occurred to me that I could fail to
find an opening. Plenty of actors with no more ability
than I have been advanced to stellar rôles. That
sounds conceited, but it isn’t. It’s a fact. But when
I approached my managers, Buffer and Lane, with the
proposition, they turned me down. Said the play was
all right and wanted to buy it, but wouldn’t give me
the leading part. They wanted that for one of their
pets. Of course, I refused to let them have it and
went to another firm, who were not supposedly connected
with Buffer and Lane.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It was the same story there. Nothing doing for
me. I tried still another man with the same result,
and then I got mad. If they wouldn’t bring me out
I’d produce the play myself. I knew it would make
a hit if it got a chance, and I had lately received a
legacy from my grandmother, which was enough to
cover all initial expenses of the production. So I
went blithely on my way, had the scenery done, engaged
the company, got the costumes made. I went
to one of the independent managers in New York
and got him to promise to put me on at his theatre
providing the play tried out successfully. And he
insisted that the opening performance should be given
in New Haven. Of course, he was right. College men
are the best critics in the world, and if a play, especially
of this sort, succeeds here, it will go anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick nodded understandingly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course,” he agreed quickly. “What’s your trouble,
then? Why don’t you produce it at one of the
small theatres?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Simply because Buffer and Lane object, and the
trust, booking Buffer and Lane’s companies, has lent
an acquiescent ear. They absolutely refuse to give
me a single date at either place. They say every
night is booked for the remainder of the season.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What nonsense!” Merriwell exclaimed. “Surely
there must be some open nights.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course there are,” Demarest returned quickly.
“But not for yours truly. Don’t you see their game?
If they can prevent my appearing in New Haven, they
figure that I won’t get a show anywhere, and then
they probably imagine that I’ll crawl and let them have
the play.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick’s face flushed and his eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What a lot of sharks they must be!” he exclaimed.
“By Jove! I wish you could find some place they don’t
control and beat them out at their own game.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You can’t wish it any more fervently than I do,”
Demarest returned seriously.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Have you tried the Strand?” Merriwell asked presently.</p>

<p class='c002'>The actor nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, and was politely but firmly turned down.”</p>

<p class='c002'>For a few minutes there was silence. Demarest
toyed with his ice, while Merriwell gazed thoughtfully
at the tablecloth. Suddenly he raised his head
and his eyes brightened.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ve got it!” he exclaimed eagerly. “The old
Concert Hall. I’ll bet none of the New York managers
control that!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest looked dubious.</p>

<p class='c002'>“The Concert Hall!” he echoed. “But that’s got a—a—well,
a reputation, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, it has,” Dick admitted, “but I don’t see why
that should stand in your way. If it was made clear
that you were unable to bring out a play at any of
the other houses, I don’t think people would stay
away on account of the reputation of that house. Certainly
the fellows wouldn’t. They go to see everything
in the nature of college plays which comes to
town. I admit that, more often than not, they go
with the idea of picking flaws in the piece, but if it’s
what you say it is, it ought to succeed. At any rate,
you’d have your audience, and it would be up to you
to do the rest.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest’s eyes brightened and he nodded emphatically.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You can trust me for that,” he said decidedly. “All
I want is the audience. The play’s all right. Buffer
and Lane would never have made an offer for it if it
hadn’t been pretty good. I don’t know but that idea
of yours will prove a life saver, Merriwell. I was
just about at my wit’s end, but you’ve put new heart
into me.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Summoning the waiter, he paid the check, and they
walked out to the lobby.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I believe I’ll go down there right away,” Demarest
said, after a moment’s consideration. “It’s the only
chance left, and I have got to decide one way or another
at once. It isn’t fair for me to keep the company
on a string any longer if there’s not going to be
an opportunity of opening here. Won’t you come
along with me? You’ve started the thing going, and
it’s only fair to see me through.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course I will,” Dick said quickly. “I’m so
keen about it, I don’t want to miss a single trick.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Getting into their coats, they hurried out of the
hotel and five minutes later had reached the old Concert
Hall. It was a house of good size and in its prime had
been the scene of many well-known productions, but
for years having been given over to vaudeville, moving
pictures, and shows of a certain grade, it was in a
wretched state of dinginess.</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest was almost discouraged as he stood in the
centre of the orchestra and looked about him. The
place seemed utterly impossible, but presently his
trained eye took in the various good points, which included
an ample stage, though, at present, it was cluttered
with odds and ends and backed with faded,
crude, fearfully painted scenery.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Pretty bad, isn’t it?” he remarked. “I can’t imagine
a high-grade audience consenting to spend three
hours here.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“All the same,” Dick said quickly, “a little work
will make a wonderful improvement. How’s the stage?
Is it big enough?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Plenty. My sets will fit all right, but I shudder
to think what that drop curtain looks like.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He smiled wryly as he glanced up at the rolled-up
curtain.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ve never seen it, but I should imagine it was
the limit,” Merriwell answered. “Couldn’t it be
painted over, or something like that?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I suppose so.”</p>

<p class='c002'>After another searching look around, Demarest led
the way through a door back of the boxes to the stage
itself. It certainly was dilapidated, and the dressing
rooms were cramped and bad, but the young actor
was at his wit’s end; and when he left the place an
hour later he had engaged the house for Thursday
night of that week, had the signed lease in his pocket
and, more than that, had paid the money down. He
had learned to leave nothing to chance. He had a feeling
that the moment the members of the trust learned
of the step he had taken they would do their best to
prevent his opening even at the Concert Hall, and he
was determined that they should not succeed.</p>

<p class='c002'>That afternoon was a busy one. Before dark, Demarest
had engaged an army of cleaners, scrubwomen,
and painters, to report the first thing in the morning
at the theatre. He had gone to the printer’s and ordered
special paper printed in which was stated that,
owing to the impossibility of obtaining a date at any
other theatre, Austin Demarest, the talented young
actor who had done such good work in the productions
of the late Richard Manton, and latterly under the
management of Buffer and Lane, was forced to bring
out his new drama of college life, “Jarvis of Yale,”
at the Concert Hall, which had been especially renovated
and redecorated for the occasion.</p>

<p class='c002'>These bills were to be spread broadcast on the boards
all over the city the next morning, and when Demarest
reached the hotel toward five o’clock he had reason to
be thoroughly satisfied with the afternoon’s work.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell had accompanied him on his rounds
through the city. His interest and enthusiasm were
wrought to a high pitch, and his suggestions on various
points had been of much service to the actor.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It certainly was a lucky moment when I ran you down
this morning,” Demarest said, as they dropped down
in some chairs in the lobby. “I was simply up against
a dead wall, and now things seem to be coming around
all right, thanks to your advice and suggestions. I
really think we’ll be able to make a halfway decent
place out of the old barn. Of course it won’t be anything
like one of the other houses, but it will be clean.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“And the best part of it is that you will get ahead
of the fellows who have tried to keep you under,” Dick
said quickly. “It makes me hot under the collar every
time I think of the way they’ve tried to keep you down
so that they can get the play for themselves. By the
way, old fellow, I hope you have a copy of it here. I’m
no end anxious to read it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“And I want you to,” Demarest returned emphatically.
“I want your critical opinion of it. I expect
there’s a lot of places in it where you can suggest improvements.
I’ll give you a copy before you go to-night,
and you can read it and let me know what you
think of it in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c002'>As he spoke, he picked up a newspaper which lay
on the next chair and glanced carelessly down the
columns. Suddenly he stiffened and drew a quick
breath.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Blazes!” he burst out the next instant.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s the matter?” Dick asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest’s face was set and a little pale. He was
evidently keeping a grip on himself only by a great
effort.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Look at that!” he cried, extending the paper. “Just
look at that, will you? If that isn’t a put-up job, I’d
like to know what you’d call it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick snatched the paper from his nervous fingers
and bent over the page. As he read the paragraph
which the actor had pointed out, his eyes narrowed
and a frown appeared on his forehead.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Friday—Arcadian Theatre,” he murmured swiftly,
“first production on any stage—John Tennant’s great
drama of college life, ‘Fenwick of Yale’—management
Ralph Bryton.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great Scott!” Merriwell exclaimed, looking up
swiftly. “They’re trying to get ahead of you! Trying
to cut you out by producing a college play with
almost exactly the same name! What a dirty trick!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Read the rest of it!” Demarest exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p class='c002'>Unable to contain himself, he took the paper from
Dick’s hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Listen: ‘Great football scene. Nothing like it
ever shown on the stage.’ My scene, Merriwell, I’ll
wager anything! ‘Tremendously strong third act.’
My third act is the climax of the play! ‘The whole
play from start to finish is so true to life, and so filled
with the atmosphere of a real college town, that the
spectator will find it hard to believe he is not watching
a concrete segment taken directly from the life
in the greatest university in America. The management
has been fortunate in securing the services of
the following actors and actresses for this important
production.’”</p>

<p class='c002'>Crumpling the paper in a shapeless mass, Demarest
tossed it angrily aside.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’d be willing to take my oath, Merriwell,” he
said bitterly, “that those villains have stolen the very
plot of my play; or, if they haven’t, they’ve got something
which follows as close on the lines of ‘Jarvis, of
Yale,’ as they dared, and still be within the law. They
open Friday, you see. I did not intend having my
first night until next Monday, until we got the Concert
Hall to-day, so they thought they’d get ahead of
me. Great Scott, man! If they put their play on
first, there wouldn’t be a handful come to my opening.
It would be the greatest frost you ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But you’re all right,” Dick said eagerly. “You
open Thursday. They’ll be the ones to get the frost.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m not so sure about that,” Demarest said, in a
worried tone. “People seeing a college play billed at
the Arcadian for Friday are not likely to go to such
a hole as the Concert Hall the night before for practically
the same thing. They’ll think that I am the one
who is copying their play, and Ralph Bryton will do
his best to have that impression circulated. He hates
me like poison and has been the one more responsible
than any one else for the trust turning me down.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly the actor gave a start.</p>

<p class='c002'>“The paper!” he cried. “I never thought! They’ll
get theirs out ahead of ours, and there won’t be a
square foot of boarding left by the time mine are
printed in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But they don’t know about what you’ve done to-day,”
Dick objected. “They don’t know you’ve hired
the Concert Hall.</p>

<p class='c002'>“They’ll find out quick enough when they go to
Lawford in the morning,” Demarest said despairingly.
“He’ll tell them about my bills. The printer won’t
have them ready until ten o’clock, and they’ll pay Lawford
a bonus to put theirs up instead of mine. I know
them and their tricks. And if the town isn’t well
papered, we might as well give up on the spot.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE POWER OF PERSUASION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>It seemed as if this final catastrophe was the last
straw which broke the camel’s back. Austin Demarest
had held out bravely against the many blows which
fickle fortune had showered upon him. He had deliberately
placed himself in opposition to a great power,
and, with smiling face and never-failing courage, had
resolutely held out against their machinations.</p>

<p class='c002'>They had shut the doors of most reputable theatres
against him, and he had circumvented them. They
had threatened members of the theatrical profession
with their displeasure if any of them agreed to play
for Demarest, but in spite of that, the young actor had
gathered together a very fair company, many of whom
had signed with him knowing full well that they were
spoiling their chances with the syndicate, but trusting
to the talented, magnetic young actor-manager to pull
things through. The leading lady, Marion Gray, had
refused an offer from Buffer and Lane of twice the
money Demarest was able to give her, but it was rumored
that she was so attached to the latter that she
would have played for him without any salary at all.
Demarest himself seemed to be the only one of the
company who had not observed the significant signs
on the part of the very attractive young lady, and had
gone on his way seeming serenely unconscious of the
state of affairs.</p>

<p class='c002'>But now this last blow had utterly unnerved him.
It was so totally unexpected and had come at a time
when he had at last begun to see light through the dark
clouds, that it was no wonder he was discouraged.
There seemed to be no way by which he could come
out ahead this time, and he sat there in the big leather
chair, a feeling of hopeless failure in his heart.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick Merriwell was not so easily downed. He
snatched out his watch and, with a swift glance at it,
sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come on, old fellow,” he said incisively. “We
haven’t got a minute to lose.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest stood up slowly, instinctively. His eyes
were puzzled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What——” he began.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick caught him by the arm and drew him toward
the door.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hustle!” he cried. “Don’t stop to argue!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But where——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“The printer’s!” broke in Merriwell. “We’ve got
to get those bills done to-night!”</p>

<p class='c002'>By this time they were outside the hotel and hurrying
down the street. Though he did not quite see
what his new friend had in mind, Demarest was unconsciously
heartened by the Yale man’s decisive manner,
and hope began to dawn again in his breast.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You can’t give up now,” urged Merriwell, as they
dodged around a corner and went down the side street
almost at a run. “You’ve got to beat them. You’ve
got your regular paper ready. We must get this
special work printed and placed before morning. It’s
the only way. It’s simply got to be done!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But how can you?” objected the actor. “The
printers won’t stay over hours. Lawford won’t put
them up in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“We can try,” Dick ripped out. “If he won’t put
them up, somebody else can. It’s a question of your
whole future; you can’t lay down now.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Little by little, under the dominating influence of
Merriwell’s personality, Demarest’s courage returned
and his face brightened. They reached the printing
house just as the whistle blew and, dashing upstairs,
encountered a swarm of men hurrying down.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Stop a minute, fellows, will you?” Dick said
quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>The men paused, a wondering throng, on the stairs.
They could see Merriwell’s face but dimly in the light
from the single flaring gas jet.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That order for the bills of the ‘Jarvis of Yale’
production at the Concert Hall which was brought in
this afternoon,” he said rapidly but distinctly. “Have
they been started yet?”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a moment’s pause, and then a voice from
the back of the crowd growled:</p>

<p class='c002'>“Ain’t mor’n half set up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“They’ve got to be done by midnight,” Merriwell
went on swiftly. “It’s a matter of life and death to
my friend, here, boys. He’s simply got to have them
then, or he goes under. Won’t enough of your fellows
stay to-night to get them out? Every one who
helps us out will get a ten-dollar bill.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“The day’s work is done,” grumbled one man. “I
ain’t goin’ ter work no overtime.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Me neither,” growled another.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why in thunder didn’t yer bring ’em in this morning,
if yer wanted ’em in such a rush?” snapped a
third.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I wants me supper.”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a restless, forward movement of the
crowd, eager to be gone, and Demarest groaned softly.
In that single instant he saw his well-laid plans crumbling
into nothingness, his fortune swept away, himself
ruined. Then Merriwell began to speak again.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just a minute, boys, till I tell you a little more,”
he said quickly. “My friend is an actor who has got
the theatrical trust down on him. He wanted to bring
out his play in New Haven, at the Arcadian. They
wouldn’t let him have that theatre—nor any other in
town. They shut him out, but they forgot the old
Concert Hall. That’s why the show is coming off there.
And now the trust is going to put a play on at the
Arcadian Friday night which is as near my friend’s
play as they can make it. They think they’ll get ahead
of him and make him draw a frost. If these bills
aren’t up before daybreak that’s what will happen.
Won’t you fellow change your minds and help us?”</p>

<p class='c002'>He had chosen his argument skillfully. The mention
of a trust to the average workingman is like a red
flag to a bull. They hated the thought of these monstrous
creations of modern commerce, and perhaps
there was reason for that hate. At any rate, the prospect
of foiling a great combination of capital was the
only thing which could possibly have induced those
printers to work overtime that night, and even at that
their consent was rather grudging.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, if yer puts it that way,” one said hesitatingly.
“I s’pose I kin stay. How about it, Bill?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll stay if you will.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Say, mister,” piped up a small boy, one of the
devils, “who are you, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Dick Merriwell,” the Yale man answered.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Golly!” exclaimed the youngster, open-mouthed.
“The twirler! What d’yer think of dat, Pete?”</p>

<p class='c002'>He grinned engagingly at Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll help yer out, Dick,” he said impudently.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Good boy, kid,” the Yale man laughed. “You’re
the stuff, all right.”</p>

<p class='c002'>That seemed to be the turning point. Many of the
men knew Merriwell, who was a popular idol among
all classes of baseball fans, and the prospect of doing
him a good turn, and at the same time thwarting a
trust, so appealed to the men that the majority of
them turned about and went back to the printing
rooms.</p>

<p class='c002'>The foreman was won over without a great deal of
trouble. He was a thrifty Scotchman, and the prospect
of the twenty dollars which Dick promised him
considerably more than overbalanced the inconvenience
of going without his supper and curtailing his night’s
rest.</p>

<p class='c002'>Consequently, when Dick and the young actor left
the place half an hour later, the men were all busy
setting up the bills, which would be ready for the
presses in very short order.</p>

<p class='c002'>The two stopped at a near-by restaurant and ordered
a good supply of sandwiches and coffee sent up to the
printers, and then hustled off to find Lawford, the
billposter.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By Jove, old fellow!” Demarest said, as they turned
into Chapel Street again and walked swiftly past the
green. “You certainly did that trick to perfection.
I shall be your debtor all my life for having saved
the situation.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“We’re not out of the wood yet, by a long shot,”
Merriwell returned. “I have a notion that this Lawford
will be more of a proposition to bring around.
By this time he must have the bills of the Arcadian
play, and your friend Bryton has learned about your
leasing the Concert Hall. He’s probably paid Lawford
well for running his bills in ahead of yours.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m afraid so,” Demarest agreed. “But it’s the
limit, when I made the bargain with him first.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Still, Lawford gets all of his business from the
trust, and he can’t afford to have them down on him,”
Dick said. “However, I think we can manage it
some way.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Reaching the billposter’s place of business, they
found that the proprietor had gone, leaving one of his
men to shut up the place.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You don’t know where he can be found, then?”
Dick questioned.</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellow shook his head.</p>

<p class='c002'>“He didn’t say. Likely he’s home, though.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Where does he live?” Merriwell asked.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Down to West Haven.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick considered a moment. That was a good ways
off, and it was extremely questionable whether the
results of a trip down there would repay the effort.
He had a pretty accurate notion that the billposter
had been primed by Ralph Bryton. As he hesitated, he
looked swiftly about the office, and his eyes lit up
suddenly as they fell upon the great piles of paper
stacked in one corner. On the top sheet he caught a
glimpse of the words, “Fenwick, of Yale.”</p>

<p class='c002'>That was enough. Bryton had been here, and it
would be quite useless to approach Lawford.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>WHILE OTHERS SLEPT.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>After his discovery of the syndicate bills, Merriwell
turned back and bestowed a brief, but comprehensive
glance at the man before him. He was a young fellow
of medium height, with a rather pleasant face and
fiery-red hair. He was roughly dressed and his faded
overalls were smeared with paste. Dick decided that
he was one of the laborers who did the actual work of
billposting. He seemed like a pretty good sort, and
the Yale man seldom went wrong in sizing up a man.
Still he hesitated, wondering whether he had better
put into execution the plan which was in his mind.</p>

<p class='c002'>At last he determined to risk it. He could think of
no other way, and the bills must be on the boards before
daylight.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Do you want to earn ten dollars?” he asked presently.</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellow grinned all over his freckled face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s me, guv’ner,” he replied promptly. “I
sure do.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Would you be willing to stay up all night to do
it?” Merriwell went on.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sure, Mike!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The Yale man’s eyes wandered to the big buckets
of paste which ranged along the wall.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How long would it take you to mix up a lot of
paste like that?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c002'>The billposter looked puzzled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“About an hour or so,” he returned. “What yer
after?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I want about that much ready at twelve o’clock
sharp,” he returned. “I also want three or four big
brushes that you put it on with. Where do you suppose
I could get those?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellow waved his hand to where a lot of them
hung in rows against the wall.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s the matter with them?” he inquired. “The
old man’ll never miss ’em if you get ’em back by
six o’clock. He’s got a big job on for to-morrer, an’
he’s going to start at six.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t want to use his brushes,” Dick said quickly.
“Isn’t there some place around town where I could
buy some?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The billposter shook his head.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not as I knows of,” he answered. “Them brushes
is made special.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell hesitated for a moment. Then he shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c002'>“All right,” he said, “we’ll use those, then. I can
pay Lawford well for the use of them after the business
is over. Got that straight, now? Have the paste
and brushes ready for me at midnight. We’d better
take a couple of those small ladders, too. And
you are to stay here till we bring the things back.
See?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellow nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yep. But, say, guv’ner, this here ain’t goin’ to do
me no harm with the boss, is it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not unless you tell him yourself about it,” the Yale
man answered. “I promise you no one will ever get it
from me, but I’ll be frank with you——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He paused, and looked inquiringly at the fellow.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Brown’s me name,” the latter informed him. “Bill
Brown.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, Bill,” Dick continued, “I may as well tell you
that if Lawford ever found out that you had made
paste for me, and loaned me his brushes, he would
probably fire you on the spot. But, as I say, I don’t
see how he’s going to find it out. I’ll leave the money
for the brushes, and all the rest, in his desk, and he’ll
have no way of knowing where it came from.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Brown hesitated, apparently turning the matter over
in his mind. Presently he looked up.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Make it fifteen, and I’m your man,” he said.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll go you one better. It’s worth twenty to me,
and here’s half of it now.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He handed the fellow a ten-dollar bill.</p>

<p class='c002'>“T’anks, guv’ner,” Brown said fervently. “You’re
a sure-enough gent. I’ll have the stuff ready fur you
at eleven. Might a bloke ask what you’re going to do
with it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I reckon I’d better not tell you, Bill,” Merriwell
smiled. “Then you won’t be forced to hide anything
more than necessary.”</p>

<p class='c002'>As soon as they were out of the building, Demarest
gave vent to his enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By Jove, Merriwell!” he exclaimed admiringly.
“You certainly have got a great head. You remind
me of a general laying out the details of a campaign.
What’s the next step?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick chuckled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Get enough of the fellows to put up the bills,” he
explained.</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest roared with laughter.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great,” he gasped; “simply great! That’s a master
stroke, getting Yale students to turn billposters! But,
say, will they do it, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Do it!” Dick echoed. “They’ll fairly fall over
themselves to get the chance. Perhaps you Cambridge
boys were too staid for this sort of diversion,
but I don’t think I shall have any difficulty persuading
some of my friends, especially when it’s in such a
righteous cause.”</p>

<p class='c002'>It took but a short time to reach the campus, and
Dick led the way up the stairs of Durfee, taking the
steps three at a time, while Demarest followed him
more slowly. Bursting into his room, he found quite
a crowd of fellows there, who at once set up a shout
at the sight of him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By thunder!” Brad Buckhart, his roommate, exclaimed.
“It’s about time you showed up, you old
maverick. Had us worrying our heads clean off wondering
whether Harvard had roped you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes,” put in Eric Fitzgerald. “We were just about
to organize a posse to hunt you up. Where’ve you——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He broke off abruptly, his eyes fastened with a look
of horror on the entering Demarest, while he threw
out both hands as if to ward off something unspeakably
awful.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Take him away!” he gasped, rolling his eyes ceilingward.
“This is dreadful! I haven’t had a drink
in weeks, and yet I see two Merriwells. It’s worse
than snakes! For heaven sakes, somebody take one of
’em away!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Exclamations of astonishment arose from the other
fellows at the sight of the amazing resemblance between
the two men.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Stop your nonsense, Fitz!” Dick admonished.
“Fellows, this is my friend, Austin Demarest, who is
going to bring out a corking Yale play here next
Thursday.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s the relation, pard?” Buckhart grinned, as
he shook hands with the actor. “You sure had me
guessing for a minute.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Me, too,” put in Rudolph Rose. “It’s the greatest
thing I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“None whatever,” Dick explained. “I met Mr.
Demarest for the first time this morning, but I can
assure you he’s the goods, all right.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fitzgerald withdrew his gaze from the ceiling, with
a profound sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Delighted to meet you,” he said fervently, as he
clasped Demarest’s hand. “For a moment I had a
horrid thought—— However, we won’t dwell on
that. Jove! I can’t get used to the two of you yet.”</p>

<p class='c002'>After everybody had met the stranger, and the
crowd settled down to comparative quiet, Dick took
the floor.</p>

<p class='c002'>“We’ve got a ticklish job on hand to-night, boys,”
he said earnestly, “and I want your help. Demarest
has a dandy play, which he has got to bring out in
New Haven. He’s up against the trust, and they
won’t let him have a decent theatre, so he’s taken the
old Concert Hall. We thought everything was settled
all right this afternoon, but now it appears that the
trust has a play as nearly like Demarest’s as possible,
even to the name, which they are going to shove into
the Arcadian on Friday. It’s a put-up job, you see,
to give him a frost. They’ve hired Lawford to cover
the boards with their bills to-morrow morning, though
Demarest had a previous understanding with the fellow
that his paper would go up as soon as it was
printed. We’ve persuaded the printers to work overtime,
and the bills will be ready at midnight. Now,
what I want to do is to get them on the boards before
daylight. Also every dead wall we can get the privilege
on. Catch on?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You bet!” exclaimed Fitz joyfully. “You want us
to turn billposters.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Exactly,” Dick nodded. “How about it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course we will!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Gee! What a circus that will be!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Bring on your bills, pard, and we’ll get ’em up or
perish in the attempt.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The assent was perfectly unanimous. Every one
seemed to think it a great lark, and was eager for the
fun to commence. But there was still two hours before
the bills would be ready, so Dick took the opportunity
of giving the boys a more comprehensive sketch
of what Demarest was up against, and the troubles he
had had to get a hearing for the play.</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellows were all much interested, and then and
there they resolved themselves into an informal committee
of six to spread the news throughout the university,
and collect as large an audience as possible for
Thursday night.</p>

<p class='c002'>About eleven o’clock they all sallied forth in high
spirits, and made at once for the printing establishment.
Here they found that the presses were all running full
blast, and the bills close to completion. The foreman
assured Dick that the last one would be run off in
about half an hour, so the latter dispatched Buckhart
to see if he couldn’t find some sort of a vehicle in
which they could transport the paper. That was the
one point on which he had slipped up. He had expected
that they would be able to carry the bills, but a
sight of the volume already printed showed him at once
that this was impossible.</p>

<p class='c002'>While Buckhart was gone, Merriwell and Demarest
paid all the men off, and thanked them heartily for the
help they had given, besides presenting each of them
with two tickets for the show.</p>

<p class='c002'>Precisely at half-past eleven the last bill was run off,
the great presses stopped, and the printers grabbed
up coats and hats, and hurried out of the place. The
foreman remained a few minutes to show Dick which
were the large bills to be posted up, and which the
smaller posters to attach to the colored lithographs for
the store windows, which they proposed distributing
the moment the shops opened in the morning. They
were really counting more on these than the announcements
on the boards, for they felt pretty certain that
the latter would not remain uncovered long, once Lawford
got started with his work for the trust in the
morning. They would be up long enough, however, to
attract considerable attention, and Dick had a little
scheme by which he hoped to circumvent Lawford if
the latter did cover them.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently Brad appeared, with the announcement
that he had a cab below, and all hands turned to to
carry the bills downstairs. In the street outside they
found a rather dilapidated specimen of four-wheeler,
which the Texan had picked up at the station, into
which they piled the paper until there was room for
nothing else.</p>

<p class='c002'>The driver seemed to take it as some college prank,
and, assured of his money, which he had obtained in
advance, looked upon them with a tolerant eye.</p>

<p class='c002'>At the billposter’s, they found Brown on the alert,
and the paste and brushes ready for them. His eyes
bulged a little when he saw the cab full of paper, but
he asked no questions. He rather hoped that the
night’s work would hit his boss hard, for Lawford
was a hard man to work for, and was cordially hated
by the fellows under him.</p>

<p class='c002'>Several buckets of the paste, the brushes, and two
ladders were wedged into the cab somehow, and then
the fun commenced.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell’s plan of campaign was masterly. He
avoided carefully the central part of the town, in which
the cops were apt to be more or less wide awake, and
proceeded at once to the outskirts, where they could
work undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c002'>Quietly and swiftly, board after board was covered
with the flaring announcements. Many of them were
slapped on crooked, and several times they got the
different sections misplaced, so that the bottom part
came first, but Demarest was rather pleased at that
than otherwise. He thought it would attract more attention
than if they had been put on with the customary
skill and regularity.</p>

<p class='c002'>The fellows were having the time of their lives. Before
long they were smeared with paste from head to
foot, but that did not matter. They slathered the
bills on as if their lives depended on their speed, and
the little spice of risk—for the cops were pretty sure
to question such proceedings if they got onto the game—only
added to the enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c002'>Working with the utmost method, they slowly circled
the town, approaching nearer and nearer to the
central zone of danger. Several times they had narrow
escapes, but they always managed to pull out
before the cops actually caught them, though more
than once they were obliged to run, leaving only the
top section of the bill affixed to the board. It is safe
to say, however, that those incomplete sections, breaking
off abruptly in the middle of the announcement,
attracted more attention from the passers-by in the
morning, and stimulated their curiosity to a much
greater extent than anything else.</p>

<p class='c002'>At last they reached Chapel Street, just opposite the
campus, and here Fitz conceived the audacious scheme
of putting one of their bills on the board in front of
the Arcadian Theatre. This was carrying the war
into the enemy’s camp with a vengeance, but Dick at
once perceived the advertising value of such a thing,
and they proceeded to plan it with care.</p>

<p class='c002'>An officer’s beat took in Chapel Street between York
and Orange, a matter of five blocks. Merriwell stationed
the cab well around the corner on High Street,
and then carried the paste and one of the bills into a
doorway nearer the corner. There they thoroughly
pasted the first part of the bill, while Buckhart, keeping
watch at the corner, gave the word when the cop
was well away from the front of the theatre.</p>

<p class='c002'>As soon as the coast was clear, Dick and Fitz dashed
out, carrying the pasted sheet between them, while
Rudolph Rose came along with the brush. A few deft
dabs with the latter served to fix the paper to the
board, and then they darted into concealment again, to
await another round on the part of the officer.</p>

<p class='c002'>He passed the billboard the first time without noticing
the change, but on his return trip, he seemed to be
attracted by the unfinished look of the thing.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Begorrah!” the listening fellows heard him mutter.
“It’s careless Johnny Lawford’s min is gettin’ to be.
Runnin’ off an’ l’avin’ the board half done. ‘Jarvis of
Yale.’ A foine show’, I doubt not.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The moment his back was turned, the next sheet
was added to the board, and the announcement completed.
The fellows did not stay to hear the officer’s
comments on his return trip. But they laughed gleefully
as they pictured his astonishment when he saw,
the bill of a Concert Hall production before the Arcadian
Theatre.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was nearly five o’clock when the empty pails and
brushes were returned to the billposter’s establishment.
Bill Brown promptly hung the latter in their
place, washed out the pails, and put them away. Then,
locking the door, he departed with a hearty good
night, one hand clutching two crisp ten-dollar notes,
thrust deep in his trousers pocket.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Yale men accompanied Demarest to the hotel,
and helped him carry in what remained of the bills.
Then they left him, and made their way to their various
quarters in high glee at the success of the night’s
work.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE RAGE OF RALPH BRYTON.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>A good many people in New Haven were surprised
next morning when they read the bills announcing the
production of an apparently decent play at the old
Concert Hall. Some of the older inhabitants harked
back to the good old days, when that was the only
theatre in town, and were thereby moved to read the
bill to the very end, thus becoming interested in the
contest between the young actor-manager and the trust,
which was exactly what Demarest wanted.</p>

<p class='c002'>John Lawford, the billposter, was more than surprised.
He was puzzled, perplexed, and furiously
angry. He saw at once that Demarest had stolen a
march on him, and he did his best to nullify the
advantage gained, by covering the boards as swiftly as
possible with the announcements of the Arcadian production.
Although he had made a verbal agreement
with the young actor to give his paper space, he was
able to slide out of it because there had been no written
contract, and he dared not disobey the emphatic commands
of Ralph Bryton, on whom his bread and butter
depended.</p>

<p class='c002'>But all this took time. It was nearly noon before
he had obliterated the greater part of the work of the
Yale students last night, and a good many people had
seen the original bills, and read them through. Their
interest was only stimulated when they noticed them,
one by one, being covered by the announcements of
the trust. It seemed to bear out Demarest’s statement
that he was being hounded by the syndicate men, and
a good many citizens decided on the spot to attend the
performance of “Jarvis of Yale,” and see what it was
like.</p>

<p class='c002'>While Lawford was working so hard, Austin
Demarest was putting in some equally effective licks.
Bright and early he started out with two boys and a
quantity of lithographing, his regular paper, and in a
very short time had obtained points of vantage in all
the important shop windows, for which he paid on the
spot, and about eleven he returned to the hotel empty-handed,
but with a feeling of intense satisfaction at
having circumvented Ralph Bryton effectually.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had scarcely entered the lobby before his eyes
fell upon that gentleman himself, and he saw at once
that the representative of the trust was not in the best
sort of humor. He was striding up and down the
floor, pulling his heavy mustache, and scowling fiercely
under beetling brows.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was a man of about forty, heavily built, and a
little inclined toward corpulency. His features were
good, but his expression was domineering, as if he
were accustomed to have his own way, and would
fly into a passion when thwarted.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had slept late that morning, secure in the consciousness
that he had done a good day’s work, and
effectually prevented the man he hated from having
any sort of a success in New Haven, even if he once
secured a foothold.</p>

<p class='c002'>After a leisurely breakfast, he took a stroll down the
street, and his astonishment and anger can better be
imagined than described when his eyes fell upon the
announcement which graced the board in front of the
Arcadian Theatre. Lawford had not yet reached that
part of the city.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bryton stormed and raged, and even went so far as
to try and tear the paper off, but the paste had been
well mixed, and his efforts were in vain.</p>

<p class='c002'>Fairly foaming at the mouth, he dashed back to the
hotel, and tried to get Lawford on the telephone, but
no one answered him. He had just come away from
the booth after a second attempt when his eyes fell
upon the smiling face of Austin Demarest, and he
promptly crossed the lobby, and confronted the young
actor.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You young blackguard!” he frothed. “How dare
you put up posters in front of my theatre? How dare
you use any of the boards which I control for your
rotten paper?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest’s eyes narrowed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just keep a civil tongue in your mouth, Bryton,”
he said coldly. “I suppose it is rather difficult for you
to behave like a gentleman, but a little more of such
talk as that, and I’ll have to hand you something.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The older man glared at his antagonist, and his face
grew purple, but he managed to keep a grip on his
temper, for he realized that his anger had carried him
farther than he had meant.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’ve no right to use the boards in this city,
which I control,” he said, in a calmer tone.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I wasn’t aware that you controlled any of them,”
Demarest returned coolly. “I labored under the impression
that they were the property of John Lawford,
with whom I made arrangements early yesterday
afternoon to post my paper.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Bryton gasped.</p>

<p class='c002'>“But I told him not——” he began, and then stopped
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Exactly,” put in the actor. “You ordered him to
throw me down after he had explicitly agreed to do
my work. That’s like you, Bryton. You can’t blame
me for taking things into my own hands.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Bryton’s eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Much good it will do you!” he snapped. “By noon
your stuff will be covered.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just the same, my purpose will have been accomplished,”
Demarest smiled tauntingly. “People will
have all morning to see the announcements, and then
they will wonder why your paper is plastered over
them. I shall take care that they find out. I have a
friend or two on the New Haven press. You slipped
up on the shop windows, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>His voice held a note of malicious satisfaction. The
older man gave a sudden start.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Lawford was to go around after——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Too late,” the actor returned quickly. “I have the
best locations cinched. They’re paid for, and an agreement
signed. If any of them try to take out my lithographs,
or cover them up with yours, I’ll sue for breach
of contract.”</p>

<p class='c002'>If looks could kill, Demarest would have been slain
on the spot by the ferocious glare from the older man’s
eyes. Bryton knew that he had suffered a serious
check, for the window advertising had always been
considered of equal or greater importance than the
billboards.</p>

<p class='c002'>He realized, however, that he could accomplish
nothing by going off his head, so he made a great
effort, and managed to get control of his temper.</p>

<p class='c002'>“After all, I don’t know why I’m going to all this
trouble,” he said sarcastically. “You’re a fool if you
think anybody will go to the Concert Hall. Why, the
place is rotten!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s my business,” Demarest retorted. “I rather
think if you drop in to the opening Thursday night
you’ll be surprised. But I really must tear myself
away. This has been a great pleasure, and I trust I
shall see you again.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without waiting for an answer, he turned on his
heel, and started toward the door. The next minute
he stopped and looked back.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Can’t I give you a couple of seats for Thursday?”
he smiled. “I should be delighted to have your critical
opinion of the performance.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Bah!” snarled Bryton, his face purpling dangerously.</p>

<p class='c002'>The young actor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Too bad you’re feeling that way this morning,”
he said airily. “You really ought to take something—a
bromo seltzer might do.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Bryton gazed loweringly after the graceful figure of
the young man as he disappeared through the door.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll get you yet, my young cockerel!” he muttered
fiercely. “You think you’ve got the best of Ralph
Bryton, but you’re mistaken. You won’t crow so loud
before I’m through with you.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Happily his work was so arranged that morning that
Dick Merriwell was through for the day at eleven
o’clock. Truth to tell, he might just as well have absented
himself altogether for all the good the lectures
did him, for his mind was so full of the brave struggle
his new friend was making for success that he
gave little thought to anything else.</p>

<p class='c002'>Chancing upon G. Grossman, editor in chief of the
<i>Comet</i>, he took the opportunity of giving him a full
account of Demarest, his play, and the trouble he was
having to get a hearing. Grossman was much interested,
and promised to write the matter up for the
paper, which was exactly what Dick wanted.</p>

<p class='c002'>The moment he escaped from the Chemical Lab, he
made his way as quickly as he could to the Concert
Hall, which he found a scene of the utmost bustle and
confusion.</p>

<p class='c002'>An army of scrubwomen were busy in the auditorium
and balcony; painters were at work on the
boxes, and in various other parts of the house, while
from the flies came the sound of sawing and hammering.</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest seemed to be everywhere at once, directing,
advising, joking with the workmen, and generally
hustling things along. His eyes brightened as he saw
Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>“The top of the morning to you, Richard!” he cried
from the stage. “You’re a sight for sore eyes. Come
up and hear the news.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Vaulting over the orchestra space, the Yale man
leaped lightly to the stage, and joined his friend.</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest narrated with gusto his success in placing
the lithographs, and then went on to tell about the
interview with Bryton.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It was a bitter pill for him to swallow,” he concluded.
“He looked as if he could have knifed me
with all the pleasure in the world. He’s always hated
me like poison, you know, ever since I came to Buffer
and Lane.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s he got against you?” Merriwell asked curiously.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Search me,” Demarest returned. “The only reason
I can think of is that I played opposite to Marion
Gray all last season. He’s stuck on her, you know,
and I suppose he got jealous seeing me make love to
her every night, and twice on Saturday. They said he
nearly went off his head when she refused to sign with
them this season, but came to me instead. Marion’s a
jolly good sort, and one of the best leading women in
the country. I was mighty lucky to get her. She’ll be
here with all the rest of the company this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick was about to inquire further about Bryton,
when the drays appeared at the stage entrance with
the scenery, which had, up to this time, been left in
the cars on a siding.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I couldn’t rest till I got them safely here,” the
actor explained, as he hurried over to direct the unloading.
“It would be just like Bryton to hire somebody
to slash them up, and ruin them. He’d do anything
to prevent this performance, but I think we have
him in a hole. I’ve got the stuff here before he’s had
time to think.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The arrival of the sets added considerably to the
general confusion, but nothing could daunt Demarest.
In spite of the fact that he had had practically no sleep
the night before, he was in the highest of spirits over
his success, for which he gave Merriwell every credit,
and all afternoon he did not stir from the theatre,
with the result that a tremendous amount of work was
done before the workmen left the place. The young
actor was confident that another two days would see
a remarkable transformation in the dingy edifice.</p>

<p class='c002'>On account of football practice, Dick could not be
with him after three o’clock, but he stopped at the
theatre on his way back from the field, and found
Demarest on the point of leaving.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Jump in, and I’ll take you back to the hotel,” he
said, without leaving his seat at the wheel of his car.
“How have things gone?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Splendidly!” Demarest exclaimed enthusiastically,
as he stepped into the tonneau. “Another two days
will see everything in first-class shape. The men have
caught on to what I want, and are going at it with a
will, for they understand the need for haste. I shan’t
have to spend so much of my time looking after them
to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Company come yet?” Dick inquired.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes; they arrived at four-fifty,” the actor returned.
“Haven’t seen them yet, but they phoned me from the
hotel. Yes, thanks to you, I think we’re going to pull
through in fine shape.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The car drew up before the New Haven House, and
the actor leaped out.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come in, won’t you?” he urged. “I’d like to have
you meet the people. They’re a nice lot.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Guess I’d better wait until to-morrow,” Merriwell
said. “We’ve got a football meeting on hand right
after supper, and I’ll have to hustle to get through in
time. I wish you’d let me have that manuscript of the
play you spoke about, though. I want to read it to-night,
if I can manage to stay awake.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course!” Demarest exclaimed. “I’d forgotten
all about it. Just wait a second while I get it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He disappeared into the hotel, returning five minutes
later with a square, flat parcel, which he handed to Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>“There. Don’t hesitate to blue pencil it wherever
you find any faults,” he said. “We’ll have the dress
rehearsal Thursday morning, and can introduce any
changes then. We’ve rehearsed so much that the people
are all letter-perfect, and there isn’t any need for
holding one until Thursday to give them an idea of this
stage. Well, good night. If you feel as weary as I
do, you’ll sleep like the dead. See you to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell and Buckhart returned his greeting, and
he stood for a moment on the sidewalk, while the car
slid on down the street. Dick had a last, swift glimpse
of his handsome, happy face, with the sensitive lips
curved in a smile of perfect friendliness, and then the
car rounded a corner, and the picture vanished.</p>

<p class='c002'>If the Yale man could have had any conception of
the extraordinary events which were to take place before
he set eyes on Austin Demarest again, he would
have been amazed beyond measure.</p>

<p class='c002'>Luckily, however, he was troubled with no premonitions
of evil. He ate his usual hearty supper with
his customary appetite, took part in the football meeting
afterward, and helped decide several important
points relative to the great Yale-Harvard game, which
was coming off the following week. Then he went
promptly back to his rooms, and, getting out the manuscript
of “Jarvis of Yale,” settled himself by the table,
and commenced to read.</p>

<p class='c002'>Here Buckhart found him an hour later, oblivious to
everything but the typewritten sheets before him. His
lips were parted, his eyes bright, and a faint flush of
excitement was on his cheeks.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Texan paused in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By the great horn spoon!” he ejaculated. “What
in thunder is the matter with you, pard?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Don’t bother me!” muttered Dick, without raising
his eyes. “I’m almost through.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Humph!” grunted Buckhart, dropping into a chair.</p>

<p class='c002'>Ten minutes later his roommate looked up, with a
sigh.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s a dandy play!” he exclaimed, with satisfaction.
“A perfect corker! If that don’t go with the
people hereabouts, it’ll be because they’re a lot of dead
ones. The part of <i>Lance Jarvis</i> is a peach, but I don’t
see where I come in.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Huh?” questioned the Westerner.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, nothing,” Dick said hastily.</p>

<p class='c002'>He did not want even Brad to know that Demarest
had taken him as a model for the hero of the play.
Excepting in a few minor points, he could see no resemblance
whatever to himself. The clever young
actor had made <i>Jarvis</i> a wonderfully attractive character,
fascinating, wholly sympathetic, and lovable.
It was what actors term a “fat part,” and, strangely
enough, Demarest had succeeded in hitting Merriwell
off to a T, in spite of the fact that he had never actually
met the Yale man. But Dick, keen as he was in
sizing up the character of another man, would never
see the resemblance in a hundred years. He was too
modest. It seemed to him the height of conceit to
imagine for a moment that he was anything like this
fellow in the play, who had interested and fascinated
him. Consequently he evaded Brad’s question.</p>

<p class='c002'>“So you think it will go, do you?” the Texan inquired
presently.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I certainly do,” Merriwell answered. “You want
to get all the fellows you can to see it. We must fill
the house full for Demarest.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Buckhart looked a little doubtful.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s got to be pretty darned good, you know, pard,”
he said slowly, “for the boys to keep from guying.
You know how many performances have been broken
up that way.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick stood up, and laid the manuscript on the table.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I know,” he agreed; “but you do your best to fill
the theatre, and I’ll guarantee they won’t waste much
time guying. They’ll be too much interested in the
play.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He yawned. Now that the tension was over, he felt
desperately sleepy.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m going to bed,” he announced. “I’d have to
prop my eyelids up to keep them open five minutes
longer.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>MARION GRAY PLAYS FAIR.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Marion Gray was a very charming young woman.
Slight, and rather tiny, she had a piquant face which
was fascinating. Taken separately, scarcely one of
her features would be found quite perfect, but one
never scrutinized Marion Gray’s face that way. The
ensemble disarmed criticism.</p>

<p class='c002'>Some one had once said that had she been positively
ugly she would still have remained none the
less attractive; for she had that wonderful, illusive
quality of magnetism, without which there is no real
success on the stage.</p>

<p class='c002'>And, more than that, she had brains, and knew how
to use them. In the comparative short space of three
years she had made a place for herself, alone and
unaided, in the hearts of the theatre-going public of
New York, which is about as difficult as a passage
through the eye of a needle by the proverbial camel.</p>

<p class='c002'>In three years she had acquired a personal following,
and a large one, at that. When Buffer and Lane
had threatened her with their displeasure if she persisted
in going with Austin Demarest, she had laughed
at them. She knew, and so did they, that such threats
amounted to nothing. The moment she was at leisure—and
probably long before—they would be after her
on bended knee, begging, beseeching, offering a fabulous
salary, to secure the actress for which New York
was clamoring.</p>

<p class='c002'>But she had reasons of her own for wishing to play
for the talented young actor-manager. Perhaps the
reasons were no longer her own. During the long rehearsals
of “Jarvis of Yale,” it had been almost impossible
to hide from the penetrating eyes of the other
members in the cast the interest she felt in the person
of the author and star. They had long ago sized up
the situation, and confided to each other that Marion
was daffier than ever about “Demmy.” They had
all seen it but the one she cared more for than any one
else in the world.</p>

<p class='c002'>This morning, as she sat alone at breakfast in the
dining room of the New Haven House, she sighed a
little as she thought of it. He was very blind. They
had always been good pals. Once she thought that
his feeling for her was something more than that, but
now she was not sure.</p>

<p class='c002'>They had been separated all summer. He was writing
his play, and she resting in the mountains. Since
their return to the city he had been so full of his wonderful
new venture that he seemed scarcely to have
time to eat and sleep.</p>

<p class='c002'>All at once she glanced toward the door, and her
eyes brightened. He had entered the room, and was
striding toward her table. In one hand he held an
open telegram. His face was full of perplexity and
annoyance.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I can’t understand it!” he exclaimed, dropping
down opposite her. “Hemingway wants me to come
to town at once. Has something important to talk
over. I don’t dare put him off, for all our chances of
getting a New York date depend on him, and yet it’s
deucedly inconvenient with so much here to look
after.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Marion Gray hesitated an instant.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How very provoking,” she agreed presently. “But,
of course, you must go. It would never do to offend
Hemingway, and you know how erratic he is sometimes.
Is there anything here to do except keep an
eye on the theatre?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not much,” Demarest returned. “They have a
good start there, and know what to do next, but I had
expected to run over two or three times to be sure they
were getting things straight.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why don’t you ask that nice Mr. Merriwell you
were telling me about to look after things for you?”
she suggested.</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest’s face brightened.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s a good idea,” he returned quickly, “only it
seems cheeky. However, I know he’ll do it if he can,
and it’s the only way out. I’ll phone him.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He pushed back his chair, and stood up.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, I’ll be off. Just about time to make the train.
Don’t worry if I’m not back to-night. There might be
something to detain me, but I’ll make the first train out
in the morning at the latest. Dress rehearsal at eleven,
you know. Look after that for me, will you? And be
sure everybody understands. By-by.”</p>

<p class='c002'>She nodded gayly to him, but her face sobered as
she went on with her breakfast. The success of this
venture meant almost as much to her as it did to
Demarest, and she was wrapped up in it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently she finished, and arose from the table.
She meant to go for a little stroll, and for that reason
she wore her hat, and carried a long fur coat on her
arm. One of the bell boys held this while she slipped
into it, and then she turned toward the door, drawing
on her gloves as she made her way slowly toward it.</p>

<p class='c002'>All at once she gave a quick little gasp, as her eyes
fell upon a man standing by the desk, and turned her
head swiftly the other way. But she was too late.
The next instant Ralph Bryton had spied her, and
stepped to her side.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Good morning, my dear,” he said, with an attempt
at geniality. “I saw by the register that you had arrived
last night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The girl did not glance at him, but went steadily on
her way.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Good morning, Mr. Bryton,” she returned frigidly.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a disagreeable note in the man’s laugh.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How very formal we are,” he said sarcastically.
“I can remember the time, not so very long ago, when
it was Ralph.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You know perfectly well that was on your father’s
account,” she retorted. “Brought up as I was in his
house, I could scarcely have called you anything else
while he was alive. Now I can follow my own inclinations.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The man’s face darkened. They had reached the
door, and, as she was about to pass out, he put out one
hand swiftly, and held the knob.</p>

<p class='c002'>“One moment,” he said shortly. “I must have a few
minutes’ talk with you before you go out. Oh, it’s
about business,” he went on bitterly, as a repugnance
flashed across her face. “I want to talk to you about
Demarest and this fool play of his.”</p>

<p class='c002'>She glanced at him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What is it you wish to say?” she inquired briefly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Bryton indicated with his hand a couple of chairs in
a corner near by, and, after a moment’s hesitation, she
took one of them.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’ve got to pull out of this company of his at
once,” he said, in a hard voice, as he dropped down beside
her.</p>

<p class='c002'>Marion Gray’s eyes widened, and a little color crept
into her face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re a cool proposition,” she remarked, “to tell
me what I must, or must not, do. Do you imagine for
an instant that I would break a contract, and desert a
man the very day before the opening? I thought you
knew that I always played fair.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yah!” snarled Bryton. “You—play fair! A lot
you do! Where’s your gratitude? Tell me that! You
owe everything you’ve got—the very clothes on your
back—to my father. Didn’t he take you in when you
were starving, and treat you like a daughter? Didn’t he
give you his name, which wasn’t good enough for you
when you took to the stage? Didn’t he leave you a pile
of money, which kept you till you got a job with Rosenbaum?
That was my money! It should have come
to me! You practically robbed me of it. And now
you stick by Demarest, who doesn’t care a hang about
you, and let me go——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Stop!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The girl’s face was pale, but her eyes flashed angrily.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’ve said quite enough, Ralph Bryton,” she went
on, in a cold, cutting voice, “to show me what sort of
a man you really are, even if I hadn’t a pretty good notion
of it before. A good deal of what you have said
is true, but no one but a contemptible hound would
have said it in the way you did. Your father did adopt
me, and as long as he lived I loved him. He was more
of a man than you’ll ever be. The money he left me
wasn’t much, but it enabled me to live until I found
something to do. The reason I didn’t take your father’s
name was because it was yours, too.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Bryton winced at the contempt in her voice. She
caught her breath, and went on swiftly:</p>

<p class='c002'>“Now, not content with pestering me to marry you,
when you know I loathe the very sight of you, you
want me to do a dishonorable thing which would make
me hate myself all my life long. But I won’t do it!
You knew that long ago, didn’t you? I’d play my part
to-morrow night if I was dying, and I mean to play it
for all that is in me. If ‘Jarvis of Yale’ isn’t a success,
it won’t be because Marion Gray hasn’t done her
best to make it so.”</p>

<p class='c002'>With the last word, she sprang swiftly to her feet,
and, before the angry man realized what had happened,
she reached the door and disappeared.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>OUT OF A CLEAR SKY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Dick Merriwell was rather surprised to get a note
from Demarest—the latter had not been able to reach
him on the telephone—saying that he had been unexpectedly
called to New York for the day, and asking
Dick if he would not keep an eye on the workmen at
the theatre that afternoon, if possible.</p>

<p class='c002'>This Merriwell was, of course, very ready to do. He
made three trips down there before going to the field,
and found matters progressing as well as could be expected.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was amused, and, for an instant, surprised, at
being mistaken for Demarest, but he did not disabuse
the men of their error. It would be just as well for
them to think that he was the actor. They would perhaps
work the better while he was looking on. Knowing
the work which had to be done, he was able to
straighten out several doubtful matters, and when he
stopped again on his way home from practice, he was
more than pleased at the strides they had made during
his absence. The place was neat as a pin, and only a
few more hours’ work was necessary to finish everything
up.</p>

<p class='c002'>He rather expected that Demarest would call him
up that evening, but no message came. Finally, about
half-past eight, he got the hotel on the wire, and found
that the actor had not returned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“He’ll probably get the early train in the morning,”
he said to himself. “I’ll hear from him then.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Having no lecture until ten o’clock, he spent the time
getting up back work. He was just slipping into his
coat to leave the room when the telephone bell rang
insistently, and, stepping over to the instrument, he
took down the receiver.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Is this Mr. Merriwell?” came in a woman’s voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“This is Miss Gray—Miss Marion Gray. I’m dreadfully
worried about Mr. Demarest. Two trains are in,
and he hasn’t appeared. The rehearsal is set for eleven,
and I don’t know what to do. I phoned Hemingway’s
office, and they said he hadn’t been there since last
night, late. Could you—would you come over to the
hotel for a few minutes? You see, there’s no one I
can get to advise me what to do, and I knew you were
Mr. Demarest’s friend, so I thought——”</p>

<p class='c002'>The sweet voice trailed off in a questioning silence.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Certainly, I’ll come, Miss Gray,” Merriwell answered
promptly. “Be over in three minutes.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Hanging up the receiver, he took up his hat and left
the rooms.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t understand it,” he murmured, as he ran
downstairs. “He should have been here two hours ago.
Great Scott. I hope nothing’s happened to him. If
he didn’t show up in time for the performance, everything
would be ruined. But he must show up—he
will!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Flinging open the outer door, he almost fell over a
telegraph boy. His heart gave a sudden throb of fear.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Merriwell live here?” inquired the boy.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes,” Dick said quickly. “That’s my name. Give
it to me.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He snatched the ominous yellow missive from the
other’s hand, and tore it open in breathless haste. The
boy saw his face pale suddenly, and heard him draw
his breath swiftly as his eyes flew rapidly over the
crowded lines on the single sheet. But experience had
calloused him to such sights as these, and, eager to be
gone, he drawled out:</p>

<p class='c002'>“Any answer?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“No,” Dick said, in a strange voice; “none.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The boy departed, whistling carelessly, but Merriwell
still stood on the stone steps, gazing blankly at
the paper in his hand. Presently he drew one hand
across his forehead in a bewildered manner.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I can’t!” he breathed. “I could never do it in this
world! What is he thinking of?”</p>

<p class='c002'>He turned mechanically and went back to his room.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dropping down in a chair, he spread the telegram
out on his knee, and read it aloud.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Arrested here on absurd charge. Cannot be tried
until to-morrow. Put-up job to hold me, and ruin performance.
You must take my part, and save play.
Otherwise I shall be ruined. <i>Jarvis</i> is really you. If
you can only learn the lines it will be all right. Business
will take care of itself. Do this as you love me,
Richard, and I shall be your debtor forever. Don’t
tell a soul where I am. I can’t afford to have my name
smirched, even by false charge.</p>
<div class='c014'><span class='sc'>Austin.</span>”</div>

<p class='c012'>For a moment or two Dick sat looking at the paper
blankly. Then he suddenly crumpled it into a ball,
and thrust it into his pocket. At least, that was what
he meant to do, but, instead of going into the pocket,
it slipped through the slit in his overcoat, and lodged
in the chair seat, close against one of the arms.</p>

<p class='c002'>The next moment Merriwell had sprung to his feet,
and was striding back and forth across the room.</p>

<p class='c002'>The prospect which had at first appalled him was
gradually becoming more reasonable, more possible, as
he recovered from the suddenness of the shock, and
swiftly regained his poise and self-control. He had a
remarkably retentive memory, and felt that if he put
his mind to it, excluding every other thing, he might
be able to get the part before night, or possibly even in
time for a hasty dress rehearsal that afternoon.</p>

<p class='c002'>As for doing anything more than that, he would
have to trust to luck. He had no idea what Demarest’s
conception was of the character of <i>Lance Jarvis</i>. All
he could do would be to forget that he was acting, and
simply be himself. It was the only way by which the
young actor’s reputation could be saved, and his success
assured; for, if the performance did not come off
on Thursday, Dick had a feeling that Ralph Bryton
would see that it was indefinitely postponed. He had
seen enough of the man’s methods not to realize that
no stone would be left unturned to thwart Demarest.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently he yanked off his overcoat, and tossed it
on a chair.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll do it!” he muttered. “I’ve got to do it! There’s
no other way out!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Then, springing to the telephone, he called up the
New Haven House, and asked for Miss Gray. In a
moment he heard her voice at the other end of the
wire.</p>

<p class='c002'>“This is Mr. Merriwell, Miss Gray,” he said quickly.
“I’ve heard from Austin. He’s unavoidably detained,
and cannot get here before two o’clock. Can the dress
rehearsal be postponed until then, do you think?”</p>

<p class='c002'>She gave a gasp of relief, which was almost a sob.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, of course,” she said swiftly. “That will give
us time enough to get through before the evening performance.
Oh, I’m so glad everything is right with
him! I was so afraid something had happened. You
know, Bryton would stop at nothing to prevent this
opening.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, I understood that from Austin,” Merriwell
returned quietly. “But I don’t see what he can do now.
You’ll have every one at the theatre at two, will you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Surely. Thank you so much, Mr. Merriwell, and
do forgive me for putting you to so much trouble.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“It hasn’t been any trouble at all,” Dick assured
her. “I was terribly worried about Austin myself, but
everything will be all right now. If you don’t mind,
I won’t come over just now. I have some rather important
work to do, but I’ll meet you later, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course. You must come behind the scenes to-night,
and meet the company. Thank you again.
Good-by.”</p>

<p class='c002'>As he hung up the receiver, a whimsical smile flashed
into Merriwell’s face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, I certainly expect to come behind the scenes,
and meet the company,” he murmured. “I’m glad she
didn’t ask any more questions. As it was, I escaped
without telling an actual untruth. I suppose Demarest
is wise in not wanting any one to know. It would
probably break them all up; but I wonder if I can possibly
keep up the deception. Gee! It makes me cold
all over to think about it! Just have to trust to luck, I
reckon. Now for it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Snatching up the manuscript of the play, he dragged
a chair close to the window, and started to work.</p>

<p class='c002'>In something over an hour, he got up, and, dropping
the play, began to walk the floor, reeling off the
part at lightning speed. When he came to the end of
the first act, he gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c002'>“One gone,” he muttered. “Pretty superficial, but
it will have to do. I must see that the prompter is on
the job to-night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>When he next came to himself another act had been
memorized, and it was half-past twelve. He had expected
Brad to come in and interrupt, but happily the
Texan did not appear. He must have gone directly
to the dining hall from his last recitation.</p>

<p class='c002'>By a quarter of two the last words had been committed,
and Dick snatched overcoat and hat, stuffed the
manuscript into his pocket, and flew downstairs.</p>

<p class='c002'>Not ten minutes later the door was flung open, and
Brad Buckhart entered hastily.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not here!” he exclaimed, with a swift look about
the room. “Where in thunder is he? Cut everything
this morning, without a word of explanation! Didn’t
even show up to dinner! It sure beats everything, the
bad ways he’s getting into!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He plumped down in the chair beside the table, his
brows drawn down into a scowl. A moment later he
slid his hand down the arm of the chair, and drew
forth a crumpled wad of yellow paper.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Humph!” he grunted. “What’s this?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Smoothing it out, he saw that it was a telegram, and,
scarcely realizing what he was doing, his eyes took in
the first line. After that nothing could have prevented
his reading it to the very end, so interested was he.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Suffering catamounts!” he exclaimed. “If that
don’t beat all! Arrested! Wants Dick to take the
part! Great tarantulas! That’s what the old galoot’s
been up to all morning—learning the stuff. It’s sure
it!”</p>

<p class='c002'>For a moment he sat there in thoughtful silence.
Then a slow smile broke out all over his face, and the
next moment he threw back his head, and laughed till
the tears came into his eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By the great horn spoon!” he cried. “That’s the
best thing I ever heard. Think of old Dick going on
the stage, and half of Yale College looking on, and not
knowing it’s him. Gee! If we don’t have a circus
to-night with Richard I’ll eat my hat!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He broke off, and glanced again at the telegram.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I can’t tell ’em, though, can I?” he muttered. “Dick
never meant I should see this. But you bet the Untamed
Maverick of the Pecos will have his share of
joy out of it. You hear me talk!”</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE CURTAIN RISES.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Dick slipped cautiously into the stage entrance of
the Concert Hall, and went directly to Demarest’s
dressing room. No one must see him until he was
made up, or the fat would be all in the fire.</p>

<p class='c002'>Swiftly lighting the gas jets, he locked the door,
and opened the make-up box, which stood on a bare
table underneath a large mirror. It was not the first
time he had disguised himself so that his best friend
did not know him, but he found that the very strength
of the likeness between Demarest and himself was
more a hindrance than a help.</p>

<p class='c002'>His keen sense of observation, however, had taken
in the several important differences in their faces, and
he proceeded to skillfully make his own an exact duplicate
of the actor’s. It was delicate work, but he did
it well; and, ten minutes later, after he had rearranged
his hair in the manner Demarest wore it, it would have
taken an amazingly keen eye to see that he was not
the actor himself. He had scarcely put down the
brushes, when there came a light, quick knock at the
door.</p>

<p class='c002'>Inwardly a little nervous, but to all appearances
perfectly at ease, he stepped across the room, turned
the key, and flung the door open. Marion Gray was
standing on the threshold, her face worried and anxious,
but, as she saw him, her eyes brightened, and she
gave a gasp of relief.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, Austin, I’m so glad!” she cried. “What a
fright you have given us! I’ve been worried nearly to
death for fear you wouldn’t get here in time. What
in the world kept you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m sorry, Marion,” Dick returned, “but it really
couldn’t be helped. There isn’t a question now about
Hemingway giving us a show if we make good here.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Putting all his powers of mimicry into play, Merriwell
reproduced the tones of Austin Demarest’s voice
with an accuracy which surprised even himself. The girl
evidently had no suspicion of the substitution, for
she went on quickly:</p>

<p class='c002'>“Austin, I’m afraid of Bryton. I’m afraid he’ll try
to prevent the performance in some way. I saw him
in the street outside just now, and yesterday he did
his best to persuade me to throw up my part.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What a scoundrel he is!” Dick exclaimed. “But,
of course, I have no fear of his succeeding. You’d
never throw me down that way.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Marion Gray caught her breath suddenly. Her eyes
were full of tears, and she was evidently in a very
nervous condition.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m glad you realize that much,” she faltered. “I
couldn’t do such a thing as that, though sometimes it’s
dreadfully hard——”</p>

<p class='c002'>She broke off abruptly, and Merriwell looked at her
questioningly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hard?” he repeated.</p>

<p class='c002'>Her face was turned away from him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes—hard to have you—make love—to me—on
the stage,” she whispered chokingly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick drew a quick breath. Great heavens! The
girl was madly in love with Demarest, and she was as
much as telling him so. There was no mistaking the
tones of her voice. He had not thought of this complication,
and for a moment he did not know what
to do or say. He had no idea what the actor’s general
attitude was toward this extremely attractive young
woman, and, even if he had, he could never bring himself
to behave in a sentimental manner toward the girl
who was mistaking him for another man.</p>

<p class='c002'>“There, my dear,” he ventured presently, in Demarest’s
whimsical tones, “you’re worried sick over this
fellow Bryton. There’s nothing to be afraid of. He
can’t stop the performance now. Come, it’s time we
started the ball moving. The stage must be waiting
for us.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Drawing her arm gently through his, he led her out
of the dressing room, and a moment later they were
upon the stage, which was thronged with the members
of the company, who greeted him enthusiastically, and
in tones of distinct relief. They, too, had been worried,
and with good reason. Capable actors as they
were, they well knew that if Demarest’s play failed to
make a hit, many of them would be in a pretty bad way
for a job. Unlike Marion Gray, they were far from
being indespensable to the trust.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was a trying moment for Dick. He did not even
know one name from another, though he had thoroughly
memorized the cast, and as soon as the rehearsal
commenced, he would find out their various identities
from the parts they took. Consequently, he plunged
at once into the business at hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Howdy, everybody,” he began cheerily. “Beastly
sorry to have kept you all on the fence this way, but
it couldn’t be helped. We’ll have to make up for lost
time by hustling things along. Let’s get busy at once.
Clear the stage for the first act.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Once the plunge was taken, things came easier. The
first act went through with a rush. Dick made few
slips, and covered them so skillfully that no one noticed
them. The cast was letter-perfect in their parts,
and had rehearsed so often that they had the business
at their finger ends.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell made several changes in the latter, which
were all improvements. It was evident that Demarest
knew Cambridge, and the ways of Harvard men to
perfection, but he had slipped up a number of times in
transplanting those ways to New Haven and Yale.
They were little things, but Dick knew that the boys
would notice them and probably josh, so he took it
upon himself to do a little altering.</p>

<p class='c002'>The big scene in the third act went with a dash
which brought exclamations of enthusiastic appreciation
from the actors. It was a scene which the star
practically carried on his own shoulders, and they had
never seen Demarest do better.</p>

<p class='c002'>The last act followed swiftly, and, with a sigh of
thankfulness, Dick realized that this ordeal was over.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had decided not to go back to his rooms. In fact,
he could not separate himself from the company now
without creating suspicion. There was barely time for
a hurried dinner before they would have to be back at
the theatre, so every one made a swift rush to their
dressing rooms, and in ten minutes they began to leave
by the stage entrance.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell waited for Marion Gray. He felt that
Demarest would have done that, and while she was
changing her gown, he stepped out to the box office to
see what the chances for a good house that evening
were.</p>

<p class='c002'>The ticket seller was enthusiastic. With the exception
of a few seats in the rear of the orchestra and
balcony, the entire house was sold out. Applications
were constantly coming in over the phone, and he predicted
that in half an hour only standing room would
be left.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By Jove!” Merriwell muttered, as he went back to
the stage. “I’ve got to do it now!”</p>

<p class='c002'>A moment later he was sitting beside Miss Gray in
a cab, being borne rapidly toward the hotel. The girl
did not say much, but she seemed to have recovered
her self-control, and was rejoiced when Dick told her
of the splendid audience they would have to play to.</p>

<p class='c002'>Entering the hotel, they went directly to the dining
room. As he passed the desk, Merriwell saw a tall,
dark, rather imposing-looking man start suddenly, and
glare at the Yale man with open mouth and swiftly
paling face, as if he could not believe the evidence of
his eyes. At the same moment he heard the girl beside
him draw her breath quickly, and in that instant
he felt intuitively that the man must be Ralph Bryton.
No wonder the manager was astounded to see Demarest
here, if, as the latter supposed, he was responsible
for the actor’s detention in New York.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick raised his head, and sent a taunting, irritating
smile toward the fellow. Then he passed on into
the dining room.</p>

<p class='c002'>From that moment things went with such a rush and
dash that there was no time at all to grow nervous.
The meal was hurried along at breakneck speed. The
actors were all more or less nervous, for any first night
is an ordeal, and this one particularly so.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick did his best to cheer them up, as he knew
Demarest would have done. He told them of the sold-out
house, and kept up a continual string of whimsical,
amusing comment all the time they were at table.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dinner over, they returned to the theatre again, and
at once dressed for the first act.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently the doors opened, and the house began to
fill. Dick had finished dressing, and was strolling
about the stage, resolutely trying to keep his thoughts
from what was coming. Seat after seat in the auditorium
without banged down. The low murmur of
conversation gradually grew louder as the house filled.
Presently he heard the sound of tramping, followed
swiftly by jest and laughter, as a crowd of college
fellows made their way to the front.</p>

<p class='c002'>He shivered a little. They would do their best to
break him up, he knew. They always did. Then
suddenly a wave of obstinate determination swept over
him. He would not let them guy him. He would
spite them all, and play the part so well that they would
have no time for that.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently the musicians began to tune up, and a little
later the first bars of a popular air crashed out.
Demarest had had the forethought to secure an especially
fine orchestra, and he was wise. The boys would
have hooted into silence anything less good. As it
was, they contented themselves with keeping time with
their feet, and when the chorus of the song began, they
joined in, singing the words.</p>

<p class='c002'>The thunderous burst of voices was awe-inspiring—almost
terrifying. Those of the company upon the
stage shivered, and several turned pale under their
rouge as they realized what they would have to face.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick noticed it, and turned swiftly toward them.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You mustn’t mind them,” he said reassuringly.
“They may josh a little at first, but don’t pay any attention
to them. Play your parts for all that is in
you, and they’ll stop pretty quick. We can’t fail, you
know, with such a play as ‘Jarvis of Yale.’”</p>

<p class='c002'>A moment later he realized that this must sound decidedly
conceited, but apparently the others did not
notice the break. They were too much intent on their
own feelings to think of anything else, but Merriwell’s
cheery words put heart into them, and braced them up.</p>

<p class='c002'>The music stopped with a crashing bar, and was
followed by loud applause.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Clear the stage!” Dick said swiftly. “All ready
for the first act?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The first set was on the campus, with Farnum Hall
on the drop, and Battle Chapel looming to the left. A
crowd of fellows were sitting on the steps of the hall,
singing in the moonlight. The men took their places,
while the other actors scurried into the wings. Dick
was with them. He did not appear until after the curtain
was up. He raised his hand in a signal, and instantly
the trained voices of the quartette broke the
stillness. Softly, at first, they crooned the words of
the familiar college air. Gradually it grew louder and
louder, until the volume filled the wings. Dick felt his
heart beating unevenly.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was another signal, and the curtain slowly
lifted, and revealed the stage.</p>

<p class='c002'>A prolonged burst of genuine applause greeted the
beautiful set, which had been painted by one of the
best artists in New York. The fellows had found
nothing so far to guy. They were fair enough according
to their lights. They never jeered a performance
simply for the sake of breaking up the play. It
was only their method of showing displeasure for inferior
acting.</p>

<p class='c002'>The quartette finished the last verse of the song,
and, taking a quick breath, Dick walked quietly onto
the stage.</p>

<p class='c002'>He spoke the first few words of his lines uninterrupted.
Then there came a prolonged burst of hand-clapping,
which seemed to continue indefinitely.
Either this was simply a mode of expressing their approval
of the actor who had produced the play under
such disadvantages, or else the fellows were trying to
break him up.</p>

<p class='c002'>But they did not succeed. Dick waited until the
applause had died away, and then continued his lines as
if there had been no interruption.</p>

<p class='c002'>After a first swift glance at the audience, which
seemed to him like nothing else but a sea of faces
rising, tier upon tier, to the very roof, the Yale man
had not felt a particle of nervousness. And with his
first lines he plunged himself into the part he was
taking, and from that moment there was not the least
sign of hesitancy in his manner.</p>

<p class='c002'>In truth, he was not acting at all. He was simply
himself, and the college fellows in the audience became
instantly plunged into a controversy as to whether
it was Dick Merriwell or some one else, which lasted
off and on to the end of the play.</p>

<p class='c002'>Once the plunge was taken, the first act went
smoothly, gathering interest as the plot developed. At
first Dick’s lines were punctuated by bursts of applause,
which usually started from a certain quarter
of the orchestra where Buckhart was seated, but, as
the play progressed, these became less frequent, until
at length the Texan sat gaping at the stage, growing
more and more certain that there had been some mistake,
and this was not his chum at all.</p>

<p class='c002'>The first act finished with a brisk round of clapping,
which did not cease until the curtain had risen upon
the stage several times, and was only stilled by Dick’s
leading Marion Gray before the footlights. Evidently
the boys were very well pleased. That was plain from
the buzz of talk and favorable comment which arose
after the curtain finally dropped.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You were splendid, Austin!” Marion Gray exclaimed,
as they hurried off the stage. “I never saw
you do better. Oh, I’m so glad! It can’t help but go
now.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“They seemed to like it, all right, didn’t they?”
Merriwell smiled. “We must keep up the good work.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Wait till they see the third act,” she smiled, as she
slipped into the dressing room. “That’ll fetch them.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The next act went with rush and vim. Demarest
had written better than he knew. There was not an
unnecessary word. The plot unfolded swiftly and
naturally, with an ever-increasing interest. The business
was splendid, thanks to Merriwell’s blue-penciling
of the afternoon, and more than one burst of applause
greeted some particularly apt sally. The scene ended
with a dramatic encounter between the heroine, played
with grace and spirit, by Marion Gray, and the villain,
in which the girl heard the latter plotting to have
<i>Jarvis</i> thrown off the team by means of false statements
that he had betrayed signals to Harvard, and
vowed that she would save <i>Jarvis</i>, whom she loved, by
going to the captain of the eleven with what she had
just learned.</p>

<p class='c002'>The curtain fell to a prolonged burst of applause,
and again Dick had to go before it with Miss Gray.
Then he hustled back to get into his football rig for
the great scene.</p>

<p class='c002'>This took place in the track house on the field.
Through a great window at the back could be seen one
end of a tier of seats crowded with spectators, in which
the real actors blended into the figures painted on the
drop so perfectly that the effect was one of a vast,
shouting, flag-waving mob of people.</p>

<p class='c002'>As the curtain rose, the entire football team was
on the stage, receiving final instructions from the
coaches before the game. <i>Hicks</i>, the villain, accused
<i>Jarvis</i> of selling their signals to Harvard. The latter
indignantly denied it, and was only restrained from
pitching into his enemy by the efforts of the other
men.</p>

<p class='c002'><i>Hicks</i> produced his forged proofs, and <i>Jarvis</i> was
thrown off the team. The team rushed off to the field,
and <i>Jarvis</i>, left alone, threw himself into a chair, and
dropped his head on his arms, outstretched across a
table, in an agony of heartbroken despair.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was a thrilling moment. The whole vast audience
was so still that one could almost have heard a pin
drop. Then a shrill whistle from the field outside the
window split the silence, and the mimic crowd on the
grand stand burst forth into a roar. Still <i>Jarvis</i> did
not raise his head.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then came the sounds of the game. The thudding
of many feet upon a mimic turf, the shrill cries and
shouts of the excited spectators, the waving of many
flags.</p>

<p class='c002'>Slowly <i>Jarvis</i> lifted his head, and looked toward the
window. The game was going on, and he was out of
it. He would not look! He did not want to, but, little
by little, against his will, he crept to the window.
The game was in full swing; his blood was thrilled as
his eyes were riveted on the field; unconsciously he
followed the progress of the struggle aloud.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick Merriwell’s work in this scene was masterly
in its simplicity. He had forgotten that he was playing
a part—had almost forgotten that he was on the
stage. For the time he really was <i>Lance Jarvis</i>, and
his expression of the heartbreaking agony of the man
ruled off his team at the crucial moment, watching the
progress of the game with straining eyes and sweating
brow, seeing the weakness of his team, and yet not
able to help, was something which could never be forgotten.</p>

<p class='c002'>The crowded house was thrilled into silence. Men
sat on the edges of their seats, with eyes riveted on that
single figure at the window, scarcely daring to breathe,
for fear they would break the spell.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently the game began to go against the Yale
team. Slowly the line was forced down the field. The
vivid words of the unconscious actor painted the scene
for the excited audience as clearly as if they had been
looking on the game itself.</p>

<p class='c002'>“They’re gaining!” he cried desperately. “They’re
going through the line with every rush! <i>Lawrence</i> is
groggy! They’re hammering him! Another ten yards
and they’ll make a touchdown!”</p>

<p class='c002'>As if unable to longer watch the failure of his team,
Merriwell turned from the window, and put one hand
over his eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>This was the cue for the newsboy to rush in with
word that the heroine had been intercepted by the villain’s
friends while on her way to save <i>Jarvis</i>, but to
Dick’s surprise the boy did not appear. He waited a
moment, and then, turning back for an instant to the
window, improvised a line or two.</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly the door burst open, and the belated boy
appeared. His face was white, his eyes shining with
excitement, a smear of blood trickled from a cut on his
face.</p>

<p class='c002'>Leaping across the stage, he caught Dick’s arm.</p>

<p class='c002'>“They’ve got her!” he shrilled. “They’re trying to
get Miss Gray into a cab. Hurry! Hurry, or you’ll be
too late!”</p>

<p class='c002'>These were not the proper words at all, but they
seemed very appropriate to the audience, who burst
into applause. Dick, knowing full well that something
was wrong, rushed from the stage, with the boy at his
heels.</p>

<p class='c002'>Outside he stopped, and faced the actor.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What is it?” he demanded. “What are you talking
about? What’s the matter?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“They’ve got Miss Gray!” gasped the boy. “Down
at the stage door. They’re carrying her off. One of
’em hit me a crack——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He found himself talking to empty air. Merriwell
rushed through the wings, flung himself down the
short flight of stairs, and burst out into the street.</p>

<p class='c002'>The boy was right. A cab was drawn up close to
the curb, into which two men were trying to force
Marion Gray. The girl was struggling desperately,
and trying to drag away the hand of one of them,
which was pressed close against her mouth to prevent
her crying out.</p>

<p class='c002'>Like a panther, Merriwell sprang at them. With a
grip of iron he seized the collar of one, and tore him
away from the girl, planting a smashing blow on his
face as he did so. The next minute the other was
stretched on the ground, and Marion was free.</p>

<p class='c002'>The Yale man would like to have stayed to complete
the job, but he knew that there was not a moment
to lose. They must get back to the stage. Half
lifting, half supporting the girl, who was sobbing hysterically,
he carried her through the stage door, back
to the wings.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s all right,” he soothed. “You must brace up,
Marion. You’ve got to think of the play. We’ll have
to go on in a minute.”</p>

<p class='c002'>She caught her breath, and brought all her will to
bear to calm herself.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re right,” she faltered. “I mustn’t fail.
That’s what he wanted to carry me off for—to spoil
the play.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“It was Bryton, I suppose?” Dick questioned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c002'>She put her hand up, and mechanically smoothed
her hair. As she did so, Dick heard their cue to enter.</p>

<p class='c002'>“There’s the cue,” he said quickly. “Can you go
on?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, I’m all right now.”</p>

<p class='c002'>They hurried to the entrance, and stepped onto the
stage. Luckily the situation in the play was enough to
account for any signs of emotion which Marion Gray
displayed, but she was very soon herself again.</p>

<p class='c002'>The first half of the game was over. The men came
into the track house, worn and exhausted by their
struggles, discouraged by their failure—for Harvard
had scored. Marion Gray told her story, swiftly,
dramatically. The villain was unmasked, and <i>Jarvis</i>
restored to the team to play out the second half.</p>

<p class='c002'>The curtain dropped to the sound of thunderous
applause. The audience fairly broke loose. Yells and
catcalls made bedlam of the place. Time and time again
Merriwell came before the curtain with Miss Gray.
At length he was forced to appear alone, and shouts of
“Speech! Speech!” rent the air.</p>

<p class='c002'>This nearly broke him up, but he managed to say a
few words of thanks before he backed out of sight.</p>

<p class='c002'>The last act was a short one, which simply rounded
things out, and tied up loose ends. The game was over.
<i>Jarvis</i> had won a victory for Yale by a phenomenal
play, and appeared on the stage, borne on the shoulders
of his enthusiastic comrades. The play ended
with a pretty bit of love-making between the heroine
and <i>Lance Jarvis</i>, which Marion Gray played with all
the fascination and art she possessed. It fairly
brought down the house, and Dick found himself wondering
how Austin Demarest could go through that
every night of the week without falling head over
heels in love with the attractive actress.</p>

<p class='c002'>When the curtain dropped it was past eleven o’clock,
but no one made a move to leave the theatre. They
simply sat in their seats, thundering on the floor with
their feet, clapping their hands sore, and raising such a
din that the actors on the stage could not hear a spoken
word.</p>

<p class='c002'>The curtin rolled up again and again, revealing the
long semicircle of smiling faces, happy in the knowledge
that they had helped score a phenomenal success.
Already they saw themselves booked for a long run at
a Broadway playhouse.</p>

<p class='c002'>Up and down the curtain went, almost continuously,
and still the crashing bursts of sound reverberated
from orchestra to gallery, and back again.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently there was a momentary pause, and then
came the deep, thunderous, blood-stirring roar of marshaled
cheering, from a thousand throats:</p>

<p class='c002'>“Demarest! Demarest! Demarest!”</p>

<p class='c002'>As he stood in the centre of the stage, with Marion
Gray at his side, Dick felt an odd lump in his throat,
and something like a mist came before his eyes. He
had never known such a sensation before.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Aren’t you happy?” whispered the girl.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick looked down into her eyes, which were bright
with tears.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='c002'>And he was. He had won out for his friend. He
had also done a piece of good work which Demarest
would find it hard to equal, but the Yale man did not
realize that at the time. He had simply done his best,
and had succeeded.</p>

<p class='c002'>At last, after Merriwell had appeared alone before
the curtain eight or ten times, the enthusiastic audience
seemed to be content, and, leaving their seats, began
to file slowly out of the theatre. But throughout
the college buildings that night, and in a good many
other parts of New Haven, “Jarvis of Yale,” and the
superb acting of Austin Demarest, were the sole topics
of conversation.</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c002'>About eleven o’clock next morning Merriwell sat
alone in his room, waiting for Demarest. A wire had
come two hours before, saying that he was at liberty,
and would take the next train to New Haven, so that
Dick momentarily expected to see him.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was feeling a little of the mental strain which he
had undergone, but otherwise was in splendid shape.
His one reply to the inquiries as to where he had been
last night was to tell the fellows that he had had a
chance to go behind the scenes, and had stayed there
throughout the play. One and all, his friends had
commented on the amazing resemblance between himself
and the author of the play, and he had agreed with
them that it was most extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was a little annoyed to find out that Buckhart
knew the truth, but, after all, it mattered very little
now, especially when he knew that the Texan would
never divulge the secret. Brad’s utter astonishment
when he found that Dick really had played the part of
<i>Jarvis</i> was very funny. He pronounced the performance
as the very “corkingest” thing he had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly Dick’s quick ear caught the sound of
hurried feet on the stairs, a moment later the door was
burst open, and Demarest, his face aglow with joyous
enthusiasm, dashed into the room.</p>

<p class='c002'>With a sweep of his arms, he caught Dick about the
shoulders, and gave him a great hug.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, you brick!” he cried. “I didn’t know there was
such a bully fellow alive! As long as I live I’ll never
forget what you did for me last night. It was splendid!
But what an old bluffer you are.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He took a step backward, and gazed at the Yale man
affectionately.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick looked a little puzzled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What do you mean?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, pretending you couldn’t act, of course.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But I can’t,” Dick objected. “At least, I didn’t
think I could.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s good!” laughed Demarest. “Why, your
performance last night is the talk of the town. Have
you seen the papers yet?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick shook his head smilingly, and the actor raised
his eyes to the ceiling.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great Scott!” he cried, in astonishment. “Not
looked at the papers! What do you think of that!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He dragged a large bundle of newspapers from his
pocket and held them up.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Notices in every decent New York daily!” he cried
triumphantly. “And such notices! Listen to this!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Swiftly unfolding one, he found the right place and
read unctuously:</p>

<p class='c002'>“‘Jarvis of Yale,’ produced last night—um—um—— The
acting of Austin Demarest in the title
part was a treat which has not been our privilege to
witness in many moons. His rendering of <i>Lance
Jarvis</i> was masterly in its simple directness, its naturalness
and truth, while at the same time his emotional
range was wide and his pathos quite distinguished
from bathos. He seemed, more than almost
any actor which we can at present recall, to get under
the skin of the character he was portraying. He
was the typical college man. Manly, true-hearted,
generous, full of the eternal joy of youth. One would
almost have supposed that he had stepped directly on
the stage from the college campus so near at hand. A
tremendous, and widely enthusiastic audience crowded
the old theatre to the very doors. It is quite safe to
predict that ‘Jarvis of Yale’ will settle down very
shortly for a long Broadway run. Certainly it would
be hard to find a more clean-cut, dramatic, thoroughly
wholesome play, without a dull moment from start
to finish, than this maiden effort of the most popular
and able leading man of the past season, who received
much of his early training in the company of the late
Richard Manton.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Demarest tossed the paper aside and turned to
Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>“There! What do you think of that? There’s a
lot more about you and the rest of the company that
I skipped. Not act, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell’s face was serious and his eyes very
bright.</p>

<p class='c002'>“But I didn’t act at all,” he said quickly. “I just
learned the lines and left the rest to luck. All I did
was to try and imagine what I would feel like and
what I’d do if I were in <i>Lance Jarvis’</i> place.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The young actor laughed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s what we all try to do,” he returned; “but
we don’t always succeed. It’s a shame, though, that I
should get all the credit of this! It doesn’t seem a
bit fair. People ought to know that I wasn’t the fellow
who played last night. I tell you it makes me feel
pretty mean to take another man’s laurels.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But that’s the only reason why I did it,” Dick
objected. “It was to save you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“And you succeeded,” the other put in quickly. “I
builded better than I knew when I sent you that wire.
Now tell me all about it. How did everything go off?
Did any one suspect? How did Marion take things?”</p>

<hr class='c015' />

<p class='c002'>Two months later, when “Jarvis of Yale” was at
the height of its metropolitan success, Dick Merriwell
received the following note:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Dear Old Boy</span>: Perhaps you won’t be awfully
surprised when I tell you that Marion and I have agreed
to travel henceforth through this weary world in double
harness. She knows the secret of my first performance
in New Haven, and when I told her that you took
my place she was perfectly horrified. She won’t tell
me anything, but I gather that something happened
that night which wasn’t on the program. She did say
she’d never be able to look you in the face again. If
I didn’t know you so well, I should be writhing in
the grip of the green-eyed monster. As it is, I’m only
curious. Perhaps you’ll put me wise next time you
see me. Yours ever, <span class='sc'>Austin</span>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>But Dick never did, and was soon back deep in the
athletic sports of the college.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE FELLOW WITH A GROUCH.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Jack Kenny was sore. He had been out of humor
for a long time—to be exact, ever since the football
election last year, in which Don Tempest had been
chosen captain of the varsity—but he had done his best
to hide this feeling from those about him.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick Merriwell, himself the best all-around athlete
in college, had more than once expressed his belief
that many of the triumphs of the very satisfactory
season of a year ago had been due to Kenny’s amazingly
clever headwork.</p>

<p class='c002'>But the quarter back was not a fellow to foster a
long-continued grouch if he could help it. He had a
decided strain of real sporting blood in his make-up,
and, after the first flare-up of rage and disappointment
when he learned the result of the election, he had
calmed down and tried to take things philosophically.</p>

<p class='c002'>But with the return of Don Tempest to the helm just
before the Princeton game, the old feelings of doubt
and resentment came back with renewed force, in spite
of the plucky efforts on Kenny’s part to take his medicine
like a man.</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest himself was not a fellow to help matters
much. He was a splendid player, and, what was more,
a born general in his ability to plan out a game and
play it scientifically; but, like many generals in the
bigger game of life, he had a supreme belief in his
own ability, an intolerance of criticism and advice, and
a certain lack of sympathy and tact in his handling of
the other players, which resulted in his being far from
popular.</p>

<p class='c002'>Men recognized his ability and appreciated the value
of his generalship, while they did not care for him
personally, which was well enough so long as everything
went along without a hitch and there were no
fall-downs.</p>

<p class='c002'>All this did not help Jack Kenny in his effort—quite
determined and sincere—to conquer the feeling of resentment
and sense of having been used unfairly, which
kept constantly cropping up in his mind. Hearing now
and then little jibes and flings against the captain from
other fellows only confirmed his own impression that
Tempest was unfit for the position.</p>

<p class='c002'>This belief was fostered by his own keen observation
during the progress of a game or on the practice field.
More than once he saw opportunities which Tempest
seemed to miss. Latterly they had had several run-ins
about certain plays and formations, of which
Kenny could not see the value, but which Tempest insisted
should be used.</p>

<p class='c002'>The result was that the quarter back’s usually even
temper had become more and more rasped as time
went on, until he reached a point when the slightest
admonition from Tempest irritated him almost beyond
endurance, and a decided coolness had developed between
the two men.</p>

<p class='c002'>This afternoon had been a particularly trying one.
Tempest had seemed even more unreasonable and
domineering than usual, compelling Kenny to exercise
every bit of will power he possessed to refrain from
flaring up and causing an open outbreak.</p>

<p class='c002'>He did not want to do this. He knew the fatal nature
of a team playing at loggerheads, and the great
game of the season—the contest with Harvard—was
too close at hand to run any chances. But he felt that
if Tempest continued in his present course very much
longer no power on earth could prevent an explosion.</p>

<p class='c002'>“He’s so darned thick-headed and set in his ways
that it makes a fellow wild,” he grumbled to himself
as he crossed the field toward the track house. “If it
wasn’t for the game Saturday, I’d have let him have
a piece of my mind to-day, and he could have done
what he liked about it. Maybe it wouldn’t be a bad
thing for him to hear what some of the boys really
think about him.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Still scowling fiercely, he entered the house and
found several of the fellows there ahead of him. They
were gathered in a little group on the farther side of
the locker room, and had evidently been discussing
something with a relish; but as Kenny entered they
all stopped abruptly and glanced swiftly toward the
door.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, it’s only Ken,” remarked Phil Keran, who had
taken Hollister’s place at right end. “He’s all right.
We were just talking about the crazy stunts Tempest
went through this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes,” chimed in Rudolph Rose; “did you ever see
anything more senseless than that fool double pass he
wasted half the afternoon on. Why a child would
catch on to it, and it couldn’t be used more than once
during the entire game.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“And that crisscross play with Baxter and Merriwell,”
spoke up Bud Baulsir, who played centre. “You
didn’t like that for a cent, did you, Ken? I heard
you kicking about it to Tempest, but a fellow might
as well argue with a stone wall as to try and convince
him he’s wrong.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“He’s so thick-headed and stuffed full of conceit that
it drives a man wild!” Kenny burst out, unable to
contain himself any longer. “He seems to think nobody
but himself knows anything about the game. It
was all I could do to keep from giving him some talk
straight from the shoulder, when he spent the whole
afternoon on those two pet stunts of his.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why didn’t you?” Rose asked quickly. “Might
have done him good.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny’s lip curled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Him—good!” he exclaimed sarcastically. “Take
another guess, Rudie. Bah! The only thing that
would do him good would be to have Harvard wipe
up the field with us, and then he’d blame it on some
one else. I’m sick of his high and mighty airs, and
I tell you one thing, fellows, if he nags me to-morrow
the way he did to-day there’ll be something doing.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s the way to talk!” Baulsir said approvingly.
“What business had he got interfering with the quarter,
anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“He hasn’t any, if I show results,” retorted Kenny.
“It’s all right to tell me what he wants before we start,
but I can’t stand this nag, nag all through the playing.
If he’s so crazy about deciding every play himself,
why doesn’t he take my place?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I notice things went pretty well while Brad was at
the helm,” Rose commented; “and he didn’t try any
tricks like that. He played the game as it should be
played, and not——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“’Sh!” interrupted Keran. “Here they come.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The thud of feet sounded on the turf outside, and a
moment later the rest of the team appeared, filling the
room with the sound of talk, argument, and discussion.
The group by the window melted away, and
Kenny made haste to appropriate one of the showers
before they were all taken.</p>

<p class='c002'>At the training table that night the football squad
was not in the liveliest sort of humor. Kenny still retained
symptoms of his grouch of the afternoon, and,
besides that, there was a subtle undercurrent of discord
which made itself felt insensibly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick Merriwell noticed the symptoms at once. He
had, in fact, realized for some days past that things
were not as they should be with the team, and that
afternoon he had quite expected an outburst from
Kenny over the rather exacting ways of Tempest.</p>

<p class='c002'>When it had not come, he was rather sorry, though
he gave the quarter back full credit for his admirable
self-control. An angry outbreak or open flare-up is
much easier to contend with than the grudge which is
nursed and fostered in secret, ever gaining in strength
and volume like a snowball rolling downhill, until
at length it proves a serious menace to discipline and
effectiveness.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had noticed Tempest’s methods of running the
team and had observed with regret some of the mistakes
the fellow made in handling the men. But he
realized that it was Tempest’s way of doing things. It
was as much a part of his make-up as his admirable
executive ability, and quite as impossible to change.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell’s keen sense of observation took in what
Kenny either would not or could not see—that Tempest
was the better man of the two for the place. His
judgment was sounder and his knowledge of the tactics
and stratagem of the game better than Kenny’s. It
was only his methods of handling the men which were
at fault and which prevented him from obtaining perfect
results.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick had worried a good deal over the matter, for he
knew how much depended on there being perfect concord
among the members of the team. To do their
best, it was necessary for each individual to throw
aside all personal feelings and subordinate himself to
the general good. The slightest rift in the lute showed
itself promptly in the lowered <i>esprit de corps</i> of the
organization.</p>

<p class='c002'>As yet he had not said anything definite to Tempest.
He knew the fellow was doing his best to secure results.
His whole heart was fixed on gaining a victory
in the great game of the season, and to that end he
strained every effort. Merriwell had tried several
times by means of gentle hints to bring about an improvement
in the condition of affairs, but he was afraid
that he should very soon feel like seeking recourse in
other methods.</p>

<p class='c002'>Thinking the matter over at the table that night
made him, too, rather silent, and added to the general
impression of uneasiness and disquiet which prevailed.</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny was one of the first to finish supper and leave
the table. Phil Keran caught up with him as he was
walking back through “Grub Alley.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s your hurry?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, nothing special,” the quarter back returned
shortly. “I just didn’t feel like hanging around there
and hearing Tempest shoot off his face.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Keran laughed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I should think you had had about enough of him
for one day,” he rejoined. “Got anything on to-night?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“No. What’s up?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I just thought you might like to come around to
our rooms and meet Clarence Carr, Archie’s brother,”
Keran answered. “You remember Archie Carr, who
graduated two years ago, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Surest thing you know,” Kenny returned, brightening
up a little. “He substituted on the varsity the
year I was captain of the scrub. I don’t ever remember
his brother, though.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nice chap,” commented Keran. “Broker, I understand,
and is taking a few days off to rest up after
a bear raid on the market. He’s stopping at the New
Haven House.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yale man?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nope, Brown. But he’s all for old Eli on his
brother’s account. Crazy about football, and is going
to stay over for the game Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c002'>They crossed Elm Street and struck into the campus
by Durfee. Keran and Kenny both had quarters in
Vanderbilt, and five minutes later they were settled in
the latter’s comfortable sitting room on the third floor.
Carr had not yet arrived, but presently a couple of
other fellows strolled in, and about half-past seven
there came a brisk knock on the door.</p>

<p class='c002'>Keran at once sprang up, and, opening it, ushered in
a slim, erect man of about thirty, with keen, dark
eyes, rather good-looking features, and fairly bubbling
over with vim and good spirits.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How are you, old fellow!” he exclaimed, shaking
Keran’s hand. “Great of you to have me here. Archie
said I mustn’t lose any time in looking up ‘Old Phil,’
as he calls you, the minute I set foot in New Haven.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Glad to see you again, Mr. Carr,” Keran returned
cordially, as he took his guest’s coat and hat. “I recognized
your voice perfectly over the phone this morning.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Really?” exclaimed Carr. “You’ve got a good
memory. Why, we only met once, and that was three
years ago.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He greeted Kenny and the other men with a smile
and hearty handclasp, and then settled down in an
easy-chair and pulled out a cigar case.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I won’t offer you one, Keran,” he smiled, “because
I know you shouldn’t take it, but perhaps your friends
will indulge. I’ll guarantee they’re pretty good.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He extended the case to Kenny, who sat nearest him.
The quarter back shook his head.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, thanks. I’m in Phil’s class.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Don’t you believe it,” grinned Keran. “He’s a
sight more important to the varsity than I ever could
be. Why, I only got in after the Princeton game by
the skin of my teeth, whereas he’s been quarter back
for two years running.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Mr. Carr seemed much interested. Proffering the
case to the other two men, who each took a cigar, he
selected a weed himself and returned the rest to his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, well,” he remarked briskly. “Quarter, eh?
That’s a pretty responsible job. In my day the quarter
back was the brains of the team.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“So he is to-day,” Keran said quickly. “He would
be at New Haven if we didn’t have a fellow like
Tempest trying to——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He stopped abruptly, and his face flushed a little.
In his haste he had said rather more than he had intended,
considering that Carr was a comparative
stranger.</p>

<p class='c002'>The latter held the lighted match suspended in the
air about six inches away from his cigar, while he surveyed
Keran’s embarrassed face with his keen black
eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Tempest?” he questioned. “He’s the captain, isn’t
he?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Keran nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a momentary pause, during which Carr
applied the match to his cigar and took a puff or two
to make sure that it was well lighted. Then he leaned
back comfortably on his chair.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s always a mistake for the captain to butt in too
much with the quarter back,” he remarked casually.
“Of course, if the quarter isn’t onto his job he should
be coached; but if he can’t stand on his own legs at
this stage of the game he ought to be dropped and
some one found who could. Constant nagging of the
quarter back has been the cause of a good many defeats.
Why, I remember just such a case in my last
year at Brown. I was one of the subs in the game
with Cornell. The captain had a grudge against the
quarter, and his continual interference got the fellow
so on his ear that we lost the game. Ballard—that was
the captain—certainly got his when it was all over
with. Coaches, alumni, and about all the team landed
on his neck and roasted him good and plenty. He
never repeated the trick.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny felt a sort of warming toward his new acquaintance.
He seemed to be a man of a good deal of
understanding, and the instance he had cited fitted
Kenny’s own case exactly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course, a fellow doesn’t mind suggestions, or
even orders, when they’re given at the proper time and
place,” he put in hastily. “I hope I haven’t got such a
case of swelled head as to think that nobody can give
me points; but what’s the use of being quarter if you
can’t do a little thinking now and then on your own
hook?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Carr nodded understandingly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Exactly my point of view,” he returned quickly,
exhaling a cloud of smoke as he spoke. “I fancy the
trouble with this Tempest is that he wants to have his
finger in everything.”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a momentary pause. Neither Kenny nor
Keran seemed inclined to pursue the subject farther.
Presently Carr looked up at the latter.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course you boys are going to wipe up the gridiron
with Harvard on Saturday?” he smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>Keran grinned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, sure,” he returned quickly. “There won’t be
anything left of them to carry back to Cambridge.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Carr laughed heartily; then his face sobered.</p>

<p class='c002'>“But honestly, haven’t the crimson boys got a crackerjack
eleven this year?” he questioned seriously. “The
splendid game they put up the other day got me a little
worried. I certainly don’t want to see old Yale
thrown down.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I don’t think you need have any fear of that,”
Keran said slowly, “unless——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He hesitated. Carr’s bright eyes were fixed questioningly
on his face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Unless—— Oh, well, you can’t tell what might
happen,” Keran finished with an attempt at carelessness.
“When Bob Hollister dropped out just before
the Princeton game it was the very last thing that any
of us expected.”</p>

<p class='c002'>A gleam of comprehension flickered across Carr’s
mobile face and was gone.</p>

<p class='c002'>“True,” he murmured, “one never can tell what
might turn up. But we’ll certainly hope nothing does.
If I were betting on the game, I think I should have no
hesitation in putting my money on the blue.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The talk drifted to other subjects, and for half an
hour Carr entertained the fellows with stories and
amusing anecdotes. He was a good talker and had apparently
had all sorts of interesting experiences, but
he also knew when to leave off. As the clock struck
half-past nine he arose briskly to his feet.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, boys, I must be running along,” he said, with
a smile. “Had a bully evening, Keran, and no end glad
to meet these friends of yours. I’ll see you all again
before Saturday, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He slipped into his overcoat and started toward the
door. At that moment Kenny recollected that he ought
to do some studying that night, so he followed the
older man out.</p>

<p class='c002'>At the head of the stairs they said good night again,
and, as they shook hands, the quarter back said carelessly:</p>

<p class='c002'>“If you’d care to drop in and see me some night, I’d
be awfully glad to have you. My rooms are on the
next floor.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thanks very much,” returned Carr. “I’ll take you
up some night and smoke a cigar with you. By-by.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE EXPLOSION.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Jack Kenny, arrayed in his well-worn, faded football
togs, sat lacing up his shoes. He was feeling fine.
His grouch of the night before had pretty well worn
off, and, as he pulled the laces tight, he warbled a little
ditty which had just been going the rounds of New
Haven:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There was a girl in our town,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And she was good to scan.</div>
      <div class='line'>She spent her days in playing games</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Where she got lots of tan.</div>
      <div class='line'>And when she saw the tan was on,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>With all her might and main,</div>
      <div class='line'>She rushed into a beauty shop</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And took it off again.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The air was insidiously catchy, and, without realizing
it, most of the dozen fellows who thronged the
locker room in various stages of undress, hustling to
clothe themselves for the afternoon practice, began to
hum it.</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny stood up and stamped each foot hard. Then,
in his droning, monotonous undertone—he had very
little voice and less ear—he commenced the second
verse:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c011'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“There was a girl in our town</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Built on a mammoth plan.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Then the fellows woke up.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Cut it out!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Shut up!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Close your trap, you old idiot!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You sound like a scissor grinder!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny ceased his musical efforts and looked around
in wild-eyed surprise.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Thought you liked it,” he grinned. “You were
all humming it to beat the cars.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course we were!” retorted Rudolph Rose.
“Why wouldn’t we when you start us going?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’d just got the beastly thing out of my head after
whistling it the whole blessed morning,” grumbled
Teddy Baxter, “when you had to go and begin it
again.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Too bad,” Kenny sighed with suspicious meekness.
“I won’t do it again.”</p>

<p class='c002'>But the mischief was already done. All the way
out to the gridiron some one would burst out every
now and then with a few bars, and then suddenly
close his jaws with a vicious snap and glare at the innocent
quarter back.</p>

<p class='c002'>The latter took his place in the line quickly. He
had resolved to keep a good hold on his temper, and
if Tempest was only halfway decent things would go
all right. He did not want to precipitate an outbreak,
for he knew that it would only make a bad matter
worse.</p>

<p class='c002'>“There are only a few days more,” he thought to
himself, “and then it will be all over. I’ll try and
be good unless he shoves me too hard.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Unfortunately, the captain of the varsity was not
in the best of humors. He had been worrying over a
certain complicated pass, which he wanted to use in
the great game, but of which he felt rather doubtful.
He knew its value if it were only properly done, but
he wasn’t at all sure that the fellows were familiar
enough with it to have it at their fingers’ ends.</p>

<p class='c002'>Consequently he was a bit short in his manner when
he ordered Kenny to start out with that play.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Fool!” grumbled the quarter back to himself.
“Don’t he give me credit for any sense? He might
have known after the way things were left yesterday
that I’d start out with that pass. You might think
this was a kindergarten!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He crouched, ripped out the signal, took the ball
from Baulsir, and slammed it to Baxter, who passed
close behind him. It was a fair pass, and the play
went through successfully.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Try it again,” ordered Tempest, as they lined up
after the down. “Little more ginger, Kenny. Don’t
hold onto the ball quite so long this time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny flushed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What the mischief do you want me to do with it?”
he snapped. “I can’t very well pass it until Baxter
gets within reach.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You know what I mean,” returned the captain
shortly. “All ready, now.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny ground his teeth and bit his lips to keep back
the retort which was trembling on them.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Gee! I’d like to give you one that would spoil
that ugly mug of yours!” he thought angrily.</p>

<p class='c002'>This time his movements were like chain lightning.
Snatching the ball from Baulsir, he slammed it back
so swiftly that Baxter, who was not quite ready for it,
clutched wildly for it, stumbled, staggered, and only
retained his hold on the slippery pigskin by a tremendous
effort. There was a momentary delay which
gave the scrub a chance to lunge forward, and the result
was that the pass netted barely a yard, before the
down.</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest’s eyes flashed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Worse than before!” he exclaimed. “Why don’t
you use a little judgment, Kenny?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The quarter back whirled around and faced him.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why don’t you give me a chance?” he retorted.
“The way you’ve been playing the game lately, it looks
to me as if you didn’t expect any one to have a grain
of sense except yourself.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest’s face hardened. He opened his lips as
though he were about to make a sharp retort and
then shut them with a snap.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’ll about do for you!” he said, in a hard voice.
“Go over that pass again, and do it right this time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Jack Kenny’s face was scarlet. His lips trembled
and he was evidently having a struggle to contain himself.
Finally, with tightly clenched fists, he turned his
back to the captain and crouched in his place.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By thunder!” he muttered. “I can’t stand much
more of that. Just about one more of those remarks
and something will happen.”</p>

<p class='c002'>This time the pass went through without any criticism
on the part of Don Tempest. He seemed to
realize that he had been rather too hasty, and for
a time he restrained his very evident desire to dictate
to the quarter back.</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny kept at the pass until the fellows had it down
like clockwork. For a time he was obstinately determined
not to leave it until Tempest gave the word.
The latter had been running things to suit himself.
Let him decide what he wanted done.</p>

<p class='c002'>Presently, however, the quarter back realized the
childishness of such methods of procedure. Tempest’s
interference was the very thing which had made him
so sore, and now he was simply playing into the captain’s
hands by his foolishness.</p>

<p class='c002'>Consequently, when he was sure that the pass had
been thoroughly mastered, he gave the signal for the
crisscross play which had used up so much time the
day before. He did not consider it of very much
value. From its very nature, they could not use it
more than twice at the most, during the entire game;
but so much stress had been laid on it yesterday that
he went through it a number of times until he felt that
the men had it thoroughly in their heads. Then he
branched out into something else.</p>

<p class='c002'>For a time Tempest made no comment, though the
fellows noticed that he was getting more and more
uneasy. They could see no particular reason for it.
Kenny seemed to be doing well enough. He was
going through all the passes and runs and formations
which had been practiced so much for two weeks
back, alternating them with skill and judgment. It
was a sort of general review of the plays which they
would use against Harvard, and the quarter back felt
that it was good season they went through it; instead
of spending all their time on one or two formations.</p>

<p class='c002'>The shadows began to lengthen across the field.
Presently the sun dropped behind the west grand stand,
and twilight swiftly gathered. Still Kenny kept up
his general tactics without returning to the double pass
or the crisscross which had used up so much of the
afternoon. At length, just as they were lining up after
a round-the-end run, Tempest spoke up again.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Give us that crisscross again,” he said shortly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Bah!” grumbled Kenny, without turning. “You
and your old crisscross!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest’s ears seemed to be abnormally sharp.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What did you say?” he snapped.</p>

<p class='c002'>His nerves were a little on edge from the mental
strain and worry he had been under for the past few
weeks, and probably his voice was sharper and more
domineering than he realized. At all events, it was the
last straw. Kenny straightened up and turned slowly
around to face the captain. His face was a little pale
and his lips firmly set.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I said, ‘Hang you and your old crisscross,’” he returned
deliberately. “We’ve wasted three-quarters of
an hour on it already this afternoon, and the fellows
couldn’t get it any smoother if they tried.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest’s face grew hard and set.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Who’s running this team, Kenny?” he demanded.
“You or I?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You seem to be making a pretty good stab at running
the team and everybody on it!” the quarter back
burst out, throwing caution to the winds. “You make
me sick with your eternal butting in. You don’t give
a fellow credit for a grain of sense. It’s ‘Kenny do
this, Kenny do that,’ the whole enduring time. You
might think I was a machine that wouldn’t work until
you turned the crank. How do you expect to make out
in the game, I’d like to know? You’ll have to keep
your mouth shut then. If you don’t think I’m good
enough for the job, why in thunder don’t you throw
me out and take it yourself? But no, that wouldn’t
do. The trouble with you, Don Tempest, is that you
want to run the whole lot of us as if we were a flock
of sheep without any ideas of our own, and a nice
mess you’ll make of it. Look at the Princeton game!
I’ve stood about all of your domineering ways I’m going
to for one afternoon. You can turn to and be
quarter yourself, and see how you like it!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without waiting for a reply, he turned and started
toward the track house at a rapid stride.</p>

<p class='c002'>For a moment not a sound broke the stillness. Tempest
glared after the retreating Kenny as if he would
liked to throttle him. The other members of the team
stood silent, shifting from one foot to the other, waiting
for the explosion with mixed expressions. Some
seemed rather pleased than otherwise at the turn things
had taken, while others, realizing the gravity of the
situation, looked serious.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You blamed little runt!” exploded Tempest as soon
as he got his breath. “If I don’t——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He broke off abruptly as Dick Merriwell stepped
quickly to his side and touched his arm warningly. A
few swift, whispered words passed between the two.
Dick seemed to be urging something to which the captain
at length reluctantly agreed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’ll do for to-day,” he said shortly, his eyes
sweeping over the faces of the waiting men. “Three
o’clock to-morrow, sharp!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The group instantly melted away, most of the men
being eager to get out of earshot to talk over this new,
and not altogether unexpected, development. Dick,
Tempest, and the coaches remained behind.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s a case of insubordination, pure and simple!”
the captain burst out. “He’ll have to go!”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was no word of acquiescence from the men
around him, and Tempest flashed a swift glance of
surprise at their serious faces.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You don’t agree with me?” he questioned shortly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Where are you going to get another quarter at this
stage of the game?” growled Bill Fullerton, the head
coach.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, Gillis, of the scrub,” Tempest answered.
“He knows all the signals and has the plays down
pat.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Almost in spite of himself, however, there was an
undercurrent of doubt in his voice.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Punk along side of Kenny,” Fullerton said tersely.</p>

<p class='c002'>“But I can’t take that line of talk and do nothing,”
protested Tempest. “In twenty-four hours there
wouldn’t be any discipline left.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He glanced at Merriwell questioningly, expecting
confirmation of his views, but Dick slowly shook his
head.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It wouldn’t do, Don,” he said slowly. “At least,
not at this late day. If we had a couple of weeks before
the game, Gillis might be hammered into shape;
but it would be suicidal to put him in Kenny’s place
now.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He hesitated a moment and then went on quietly:</p>

<p class='c002'>“I hate butting in, old fellow, but once in a while
a chap’s got to. You don’t mind if I speak rather
freely, do you, Don?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest shook his head, but it was plain from the
expression on his face that advice was not especially
palatable.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Spit it out, Dick,” he returned shortly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s just this, Don,” Merriwell explained. “I think
that, in a way, you’re a little to blame for Kenny’s
flare-up. He’s been sore for quite some time. I’ve
been watching him closely, and I rather expected the
outbreak would come before this. The reason why
it didn’t was because Jack was doing his best to keep
his temper. I think he realized, as well as you or I
could, the folly, even danger, of a split in the team
at this juncture; and I honestly believe that he kept a
grip on himself until he simply couldn’t hold in any
longer.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest’s face darkened.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s a pretty hard one on me, Merriwell,” he said
quickly. “You imply that I practically drove him to
the wall.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“In a way, yes,” Dick answered. “Of course it
wasn’t intentional on your part. I don’t mean that,
at all. I don’t suppose you’ve realized it, old man,
but you have been putting in your oar lately a little
bit more than is wise. No doubt you’ve seen the value
of certain plays, which, perhaps, haven’t appealed to
Kenny, and have consequently harped on them more
than you have any idea of. You’ve lost track of the
fact that Jack is one of the ablest, most brainy quarters
we’ve ever had, and that he should be entitled to
do a little thinking on his own hook. Besides, no fellow,
no matter how much of a dub he may be, likes to
be constantly pounded and hammered at before the
whole team. Most men have to be handled with a
little diplomacy and tact—taken aside, you know, and
perhaps asked their advice as to the value of a certain
play or formation, instead of being ordered to do thus
and so without having any reason given them. Perhaps
that method doesn’t appeal to you, but I have
found it much the simplest and effective way of getting
results.</p>

<p class='c002'>“The fellow is a bit flattered at having his opinion
consulted. He does what you want willingly, and
half the time he thinks that it is his own idea. Everybody
is happy and the goose hangs high. Of course,
you haven’t realized it, but really, Don, you’ve been
pretty sharp and domineering for the past two weeks.
I have a notion that the big game has got on your
nerves a trifle, and that, in your anxiety to prepare
against any contingency, you’ve gone at the fellows in
a way which has made others than Jack Kenny sore.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He stopped, and for a time no one spoke. Then Bill
Fullerton nodded his head emphatically.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s the talk!” he said decidedly. “Lead ’em,
don’t try to drive ’em, and you get better results. Let
me do the driving when it is necessary.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest’s face was a study. Chagrin and anger
struggled with a dawning realization that Merriwell
had spoken the truth. He was a fellow who hated
to be given advice, but he was also fair-minded enough
to know that Dick was not the sort who would speak
as he had unless there was a great need for it.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I suppose you’re right, Merriwell,” he said slowly,
at length. “A fellow looking on can get a much better
idea of the real state of affairs than one who is
taking part in them. Perhaps I have been too sharp
and quick in the way I’ve handled the boys, but, somehow,
it isn’t my way to get around a man in the manner
you suggest. If I’m running the team, well and
good. But if the fellows begin to question my orders,
it’s about time I stepped out.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nonsense!” Merriwell exclaimed. “You don’t get
what I mean at all. I hadn’t the slightest notion of
your submitting to dictation from anybody in your
management. But there are more methods than one of
getting your way, and I think you’ll find that a little
persuasion will go considerably farther than downright
bullyragging. You don’t mean it that way, of course,
but that’s how it appears to some of the men. Don’t
let’s have any more talk about your stepping out. Nobody’s
going to do that. This thing has got to be
patched up or we’ll lose the game on Saturday, the
surest thing you know. All you’ve got to do is to
take things a little easier. Don’t try to run the whole
team. It’s a wonder you’re not a wreck now, the way
you’ve tried to take everything on your shoulders.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But I can’t help worrying about things,” Tempest
protested. “I can’t help seeing where they don’t go
right, and trying my best to remedy them.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You try too hard,” Dick retorted. “If you think
it over, you’ll realize that Kenny’s got brains enough
to come out all right if he’s let alone. You’re not
going to try any more new stunts, and the boys have
got the others down to a point where their work
couldn’t be very much improved on. At least, try my
plan, Don. Let Jack have his own way for a day or
so, and see if I’m not right—see if he doesn’t show
results. He’s got to play the game practically alone on
Saturday. And it’s only fair that he have his chance
for the rest of the week.”</p>

<p class='c002'>In his eagerness to make his point of view plain,
Dick had spoken rather more emphatically than he intended.
He realized this, and went on quickly:</p>

<p class='c002'>“You mustn’t mind if I’m a bit sharp, Don. I
haven’t minced matters because I wanted to put things
plainly to you. If we can only keep things running
smoothly and prevent such disagreements as this, there
isn’t a doubt in my mind that we’ll put it all over Harvard.
But you know yourself that with a team at
loggerheads, when every fellow is taking sides and
questioning the ability of the man at the helm, there
isn’t a ghost of a show for good work. Think it over,
old fellow, and see if I’m not right. It’s only three
days now before the game. See if you can’t manage to
hold in for that short time, and we won’t have any
more trouble.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest looked up with a wry smile on his face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I reckon I’ll have to,” he said slowly, “or there
won’t be any team left. How about Kenny, though?
Will he come back?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell’s lips straightened out in a firm line.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’ll see to him,” he said quickly. “I don’t think
there’s any doubt about that.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Fullerton gave a grunt of relief as they started toward
the track house. Thanks to Merriwell, it looked
as if serious trouble had been averted.</p>

<p class='c002'>Jack Kenny did not appear at the training table that
night. His absence was not commented upon by the
other men, who knew the reason quite well.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was an atmosphere of doubt and suspense
over everything, which persistently refused to be
cleared away. Had the quarter back left the team for
good? Had he been fired off? What had taken place
between Merriwell, Tempest, and the coaches after the
majority of the men had left the field that afternoon?</p>

<p class='c002'>These and a dozen other vital questions were whispered
by various fellows to their neighbors; but no one
felt like propounding them to the principals in the affair,
who did not volunteer any information.</p>

<p class='c002'>Directly the gloomy meal was over, Dick hurried
across the campus to Vanderbilt and ascended to Kenny’s
rooms. He found the quarter back sunk into the
depths of a big chair, his face black as a thundercloud.</p>

<p class='c002'>He looked up quickly as Merriwell entered in response
to his gruff invitation, and shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Isn’t a bit of use, Dick,” he said positively.
“You’re just wasting your time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You old idiot!” he exclaimed, dropping down in
a chair opposite Kenny. “Have you any idea what
you’re talking about?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The quarter back pursed up his lips firmly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re after me to make it up with that fool Tempest,”
he returned quickly. “But I won’t do it! I’ve
stood about all of his lip that I’m going to. It’s nearly
drove me insane.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick crossed his legs and linked his hands loosely
over one knee.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It was pretty trying, wasn’t it?” he said quietly.
“But you know, old man, Tempest didn’t mean anything
by it. It’s just his way. He’s so keen about the
game Saturday, and so afraid we won’t get those plays
into our nuts, that he forgets everything else.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“The deuce he does!” retorted Kenny. “He’s done
nothing but hammer and pound at me since he came
back on the field. You might think I didn’t have any
sense at all. It’s nag, nag, nag the whole time. ‘Do
this, do that,’ without giving a fellow a chance to do
it himself. What am I quarter for, I’d like to know,
if I can’t use a little judgment? I’ve played football as
long as he has, and been on the varsity longer, yet he
treats me like a perfect kid. I tell you, Dick, I won’t
stand for it any longer. I—don’t care if I am—out
of the game—Saturday.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Despite his accents of bravado, Kenny’s voice faltered
a little at the end. Merriwell leaned forward
earnestly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Jack, you don’t mean that,” he exclaimed; “you
can’t mean it!”</p>

<p class='c002'>The quarter back nodded emphatically.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes, I do,” he said.</p>

<p class='c002'>But there was almost a sob in his voice. Angry and
excited as he had been up to this point, leaving the
team seemed the only natural thing to do.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell’s face grew very serious.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You can’t realize what you’re saying, Jack,” he
said, in a low, clear voice. “You can’t possibly be in
earnest when you talk about leaving the team four days
before the great game of the season. Surely you know,
old fellow, that such a step would give Harvard the victory
as certain as fate. We haven’t any one who could
possibly take your place and run things the way you
do. Gillis hasn’t got the head. That isn’t soft soap;
it’s the truth.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny’s slim fingers were busy tracing intricate patterns
on the upholstered arm of the chair. His eyes
were averted.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Gillis could do what I’ve been doing for the past
two weeks,” he muttered, in a low tone. “Any dub
could do that. Tempest don’t want a fellow to think
for himself.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Did you ever try and put yourself in Don Tempest’s
place, Jack?” Dick asked swiftly. “Did you ever
try and figure out what sort of a man he was—what
kind of a mind he has, I mean?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The quarter back shot a swift glance at Merriwell’s
face and then dropped his eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“He’s got a cursed domineering mind, I know that
much,” he growled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s the way it might appear sometimes,” Dick
returned; “but you haven’t got deep enough. He’s a
fellow with splendid executive ability, with a wonderfully
far-seeing mind and immense talent for the
strategy of football. Surely you’ll admit that.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“He has doped out some pretty good stunts,” Kenny
acknowledged grudgingly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Of course he has. He’s amazingly clever at that.
And it’s about those very stunts that he makes his great
mistake. His mind is so wrapped up in the results he
wants to get that he doesn’t care how he gets them.
Moreover, he’s intolerant of advice——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“And mighty quick about giving it to others,” flashed
Kenny viciously.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick repressed a quick smile. The quarter back’s
manner was so like that of a peevish child that he
could not help being amused. But the feeling was only
momentary. The situation was far too serious for
trifling.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I know that,” he returned quickly, “and that’s what
I told him this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Humph!” grunted Kenny, looking up swiftly. “I’m
glad you did that much. I’m glad he realizes that
somebody besides me has noticed the way he’s been
going on. What did he say to that?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“He hadn’t realized how far his enthusiasm and
earnestness had carried him,” Merriwell explained.
“You see, Jack, Don is a fellow who commands by
sheer force of will. We have made him captain of the
team, and he expects to be obeyed implicitly and without
question when he has decided what he thinks is
the right course. Another man might get his way by a
more sympathetic, tactful appeal; but Don can’t—he
doesn’t know how. That quick, sharp manner, which
seems so imperious and domineering, is unfortunate,
but it’s just as much a part of his make-up as any
unpleasant traits of character which you or I possess
are parts of ours, and it’s just as hard to overcome.
He doesn’t really mean anything by it, and I think
after the talk we had to-day he’ll do his very best to
modify it, if not cut it out altogether. I’ve been expecting
you’d flare up before this, Jack. If you hadn’t
had great self-control, you would have, for there was
every provocation in the world; but you’ll find things
pleasanter from now on. You’re not thinking about
deserting the bunch now, are you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny hesitated an instant and then looked up at
Merriwell, with a rather shamefaced expression.</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, I reckon not,” he replied, in a low tone. “I
don’t suppose I really could have left the team in cold
blood, but I was so blazing mad with Tempest I was
ready to do anything. Besides, I was pretty sure he’d
fire me off after what I said on the field.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick wisely refrained from telling him that such
had been Tempest’s first intention. Springing to his
feet, he gave the quarter back a hearty slap on the
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I knew you weren’t the sort to throw us down that
way,” he smiled. “Well, I must run along. Practice
at three to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“All right, I’ll be there,” Kenny said, with a return
of his usual cheerful manner; “only, Dick——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He paused, and Merriwell turned back from the
door.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes?” he questioned.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You know I can’t promise to behave myself if
Tempest starts in on his old tricks,” the quarter back
said hesitatingly. “I’ve held in so long that my nerves
are worn to a frazzle, and it wouldn’t take a whole
lot to start me going.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Don’t worry,” Dick smiled. “I don’t think there’ll
be any more trouble, but if Don should get a little aggravating
try and remember what I told you. It isn’t
really his fault, and he doesn’t mean anything by it.
Just grin and bear it. We all have our troubles, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sure,” grinned Kenny. “Well, I’ll try my best.
Good night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>When the door had closed behind Merriwell, Kenny
dropped back into his chair, a smile still on his lips.
The change of heart which Dick had brought about
was a distinct relief to the quarter back.</p>

<p class='c002'>Looking at it in cold blood, he shuddered at his
narrow escape. What an awful thing it would have
been if he had really thrown up his place on the varsity.
The thought of having the contest with Harvard take
place, and he not on the team, was appalling and sent
an icy shiver up and down his spine. That was the
event to which they all looked forward eagerly from
the very beginning of the season. It was the culmination—the
finish of all things; and this game would
indeed be the finish for him. It was his last year.
Never again would he have a chance to face the wearers
of the crimson. Not to have played on Saturday
would have broken his heart.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was still turning the matter over in his mind
when there came a quick knock at the door.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Come in,” he called.</p>

<p class='c002'>The door swung open and Clarence Carr, blithe,
brusque, and smiling, entered the room.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hello!” greeted Kenny, springing to his feet.
“Come in and rest your face and hands.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Didn’t expect to see me quite so soon, did you?”
smiled the older man. “But I had an hour to spare,
so I thought I’d take advantage of your invitation and
look you up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Glad you did,” Kenny returned cordially, taking the
other’s overcoat and hat. “Sit down and smoke one of
your own cigars. That sounds pretty inhospitable, but,
not indulging in them, I don’t keep any on hand.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Carr dropped into a chair and took out a weed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You didn’t put your foot into it the way one of the
boys down in Wall Street did the other day,” he remarked.
“He’s a pretty gay bird generally, but doesn’t
happen to smoke. One of the brokers offered him a
cigar, which he declined with a virtuous air. ‘No,
thanks,’ he says, ‘I’m not addicted to the vice.’ That
naturally got the other fellow’s goat. ‘It isn’t a vice,’
he snapped back, ‘or you probably would be.’ The
drinks were on Harry that time.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny laughed and settled down comfortably on the
couch. He had taken a decided fancy to this fresh,
breezy man of the world, who seemed to go through
life in such a jolly, good-tempered way.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, how’d things go to-day?” Carr asked presently,
in a casual tone. “Any more rows?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny hesitated and a slow flush crept into his face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“We did have it pretty hot toward the end,” he confessed.
“I flared up and gave Tempest a piece of my
mind, and then left the field just about ready to throw
the whole thing up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>A look of genuine anxiety flashed into Carr’s face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, thunder!” he exclaimed quickly. “You
wouldn’t do that, would you? Why, it would just
about give Harvard the game!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m not going to—no,” Kenny returned. “I’ve seen
since then that I couldn’t, of course; but I was so
blooming mad at the time that I was ready for anything.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The broker sank back in his chair with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Gee! You gave me a start,” he confessed. “I
thought for a minute you still meant that, and I
certainly don’t want to see old Yale licked.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He took a meditative puff on his cigar and then
went on rather casually:</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, what was the trouble to-day? That captain
of yours been interfering again?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“He sure has,” Kenny returned. “It would take the
patience of Job to put up with him.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His face darkened at the remembrance of Tempest’s
nagging. Though he had promised Dick he would
remain with the team, and was more than thankful he
had done so, his dislike for Tempest was not in the
least lessened. The feeling of soreness and sense of
unfair treatment had grown so gradually, and had
been resolutely repressed for so long, that when it
finally broke forth into a flame it was far too strong
to be quenched readily, and, almost before he knew
it, the quarter back found himself narrating the whole
unpleasant series of incidents to this new friend who
seemed so interested and so sympathetic.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Carr, when the story was
finished. “I certainly don’t blame you for raising a
row. This Tempest must be a fearful aggravating
blade. What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, I’ll have to put up with it, I reckon,” Kenny
said hesitatingly. “Merriwell says he gave him a good
talking to and thinks he’ll hold his jaw and keep his
hands off for a while; but I tell you this much, if he
starts in with his nagging to-morrow I shan’t be responsible
for what I do.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I should say not!” the broker exclaimed. “It’s a
wonder to me you’ve held in as long as you have. I’m
afraid I’d have blown up when he first started in to
bulldoze.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I felt like it, you’d better believe,” Kenny returned;
“but I didn’t want to start a row. That sort of thing
doesn’t do any good to the work of a team.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, of course not,” agreed Carr.</p>

<p class='c002'>He smoked for a few moments in thoughtful silence.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How’d he ever come to be made captain?” he mused
presently. “I should think your temperament was much
better suited for the position than his.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny flushed with pleasure at this remark.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It was pretty close,” he answered; “but the fellows
must have thought he was better qualified. There’s
certainly no doubt about his ability as a strategist, or
his thorough knowledge of the game.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But that’s very far from being everything,” Carr
said quickly. “The captain of a football team, or any
other, for that matter, should have tact. He should
know more than anything else, almost, how to handle
his men to get the best results from their working together
as a single unit. Apparently Tempest doesn’t
possess this qualification, but, from even the little I
know of you, I should imagine you would have no such
difficulties as he has run up against in that regard.
You don’t mind my talking in this frank way, I hope.
You see, I’m very much interested in it all.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, of course not.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Again the quarter back felt that pleasant glow of
satisfaction stealing over him. Clarence Carr was
evidently a man of keen insight and understanding.
It was gratifying to meet a fellow of such perfect appreciation.</p>

<p class='c002'>The broker stayed somewhat later than he had at
Phil Keran’s rooms the night before. A good part of
the time was spent in discussing the football situation.
Clarence Carr was a wonderfully clever man, and,
moreover, he had a distinct object in view.</p>

<p class='c002'>Little by little, his insidious words penetrated to
Jack Kenny’s mind and stayed there. It was all so
cleverly done that the quarter back did not realize for
a single moment that there was anything underneath
the pleasant, jovial broker’s discourse, punctuated now
and then by witty stories and amusing anecdotes.</p>

<p class='c002'>But the result was that, by the time Carr took his
leave, Kenny’s dislike for Don Tempest had been
fanned into a flame of hatred. His sense of unfair
treatment rankled bitterly, while his contempt for the
captain’s methods reached a point where he began to
entertain serious doubts of the fellow’s ability as a
leader. Under such a man’s guidance, he reflected,
how was it possible that the team could work to any
advantage? Already the fellows were grumbling
against his exactions. What would it be like on the
day of the game, when nervousness and self-doubt is
always rampant?</p>

<p class='c002'>Carr’s hearty “good night” floated upward from the
stairs, and Kenny closed the door with a sigh and
stood thoughtfully by the table. Nothing seemed sure,
now. He was even growing doubtful of their ability
to wrest a victory from the crimson.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SCHEME.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>As Clarence Carr left Vanderbilt Hall he seemed to
be in even higher spirits than usual. Swinging briskly
down the drive with a smile on his face and humming
a little tune under his breath, he passed through the
ornate gateway and turned to his left down Chapel
Street.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had good reason to be satisfied with the evening’s
work. He had been even more successful than
he had hoped. The ball had been started rolling, and
there was nothing left for him now but to watch it
carefully and make sure that it kept on its way.</p>

<p class='c002'>It took but a moment to reach the New Haven
House, where he paused in the lobby, keenly scrutinizing
the occupants of the comfortable leather-covered
chairs.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not here,” he murmured under his breath. “But I
hardly expected he would be.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without delay, he passed on to the bar, and he had
scarcely stepped inside the doorway before his eyes
fell upon the figure of the man for whom he was looking.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was rather under medium height, and very fat.
The striking, violet-colored waistcoat covered a vast
expanse of rotundity, and across the front was looped
a massive gold chain which looked almost like a cable,
hanging pendant from which, at the point where it
passed through the buttonhole, were half a dozen
fobs, lockets, and diamond-studded trinkets.</p>

<p class='c002'>In the scarf of violet silk, which just matched the
waistcoat, sparkled a large diamond. On several of
the pudgy fingers were a plentitude of rings—also set
with diamonds. But the most remarkable feature of
the man was the face which topped the barrel-like figure,
and which had the grotesque appearance of being
set directly upon the broad, check-clad shoulders without
the usual formality of a neck.</p>

<p class='c002'>It was smooth-shaven, round, and jolly, merging imperceptibly
into the bat-wing collar by a series of double
chins. The eyes were small, deep-set and blue, and
had in them an expression of such infantile innocence
as to be almost incongruous. This, together with the
soft, smooth, pink-and-white skin, gave him the look
of a plump, good-natured cherub, who had allowed his
taste for rather vivid colorings and effects in the matter
of dress to run riot.</p>

<p class='c002'>But J. Harry Edgerton was very far from living
up to his appearance. There was nothing whatever of
the innocent cherub about his personality, though he
had often found it expedient and profitable to allow
that impression to prevail. It had been invaluable in
leading strangers to stay with him in a stiff poker
game, under the impression that the pouting, childlike
look of dismay as he surveyed his hand was a true reflection
of the cards themselves. Too late they would
discover that Edgerton was simply bluffing, and they
would retire from the game sadder, wiser, and poorer
men.</p>

<p class='c002'>J. Harry had thus acquired a manner which was in
perfect accord with his looks, and gradually this had
become so fixed a habit that he rarely put it aside,
except in moments of great excitement or tension,
when his true self came to the surface. At other times
he was the bland, jolly, good-tempered and careless individual
which his appearance implied. A good deal
of a sport, to be sure, but full of bright, witty stories,
which he narrated in a droll way that was irresistible,
and altogether a most desirable fellow to take a hand
at poker or make a fourth at bridge.</p>

<p class='c002'>His small, bright eyes lit up and a wide smile
wreathed his fat countenance as he saw Clarence Carr
advancing toward his position at the end of the bar.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, well,” he chuckled, holding out a plump, pink
hand. “My old college chum! How are you, Clarence,
old boy? What’ll you take?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Carr grinned as he clasped the bejeweled fingers.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Glad to see you, old sport,” he returned. “Make
it a rye high ball.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Scotch for me,” nodded the stout cherub to the
waiting attendant. “And say—bring them over to a
table. I want to rest my bones.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Didn’t know they needed resting, Harry,” smiled
Carr, as they crossed the room to a little table in the
corner. “They’re so bolstered up and supported with
blubber, you know.”</p>

<p class='c002'>With a sigh, Edgerton relapsed carefully into a
creaking chair.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Same old joker, I see,” he chortled. “Wait till
you tip the scales at three hundred odd and you’ll feel
the need of resting something. Whether it’s bones or
not, I can’t say.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The drinks being set before them, each man poured
out a generous three fingers and filled the glasses with
carbonated.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Here’s how,” remarked Carr, raising his glass.</p>

<p class='c002'>The stout man nodded and took a long swallow.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Fair stuff,” he remarked, setting the glass down on
the table.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then he looked keenly at his companion, his fat lips
pursed up a little.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well?” he questioned significantly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Carr took out a handkerchief and wiped his mouth
deliberately.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I think it’s going to work,” he returned in a somewhat
lower tone. “Tempest and Kenny pretty near
came to blows this afternoon. In fact, Kenny was so
mad that, for a while, he proposed leaving the team
altogether. That scared me when I first heard about
it, but luckily Dick Merriwell talked him into staying.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Humph!” grunted Edgerton. “I should think that
would have been the best thing possible. There’d be no
question then about the result of the game.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“No, of course not,” Carr said quickly; “but in that
case the odds would be in Harvard’s favor instead of
being five to six against her as they are now.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Edgerton nodded comprehendingly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I see,” he returned, taking another sip from his
glass. “That’s true enough. I’m not very well up
on this football business, so I have to trust to you. But
are you sure you can work this boy so there’ll be
enough of a split in the team to make any material difference
in their playing.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Carr nodded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I think so,” he answered. “He’s got a pretty hot
temper, though he has kept it under control until now.
He’s a bit sore, too, that he wasn’t elected captain instead
of this Tempest. If the latter only keeps
on with his bullyragging, even a little, the game is ours.
Already the team is taking sides in the quarrel. Some
are for Tempest, some for Kenny; and that means
reduced efficiency in their playing. I can keep the quarter
back stirred up, all right, and by Saturday they
ought all to be at sixes and sevens.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Don’t he suspect your game?” queried the stout
man.</p>

<p class='c002'>Carr laughed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Trust me for that,” he returned. “He thinks I’m all
for Yale winning. He hasn’t a notion that there’s any
motive in what I’ve said to him, except the natural
dislike of a man to see a good fellow thrown down.”
His face clouded swiftly and his heavy brows drew
down into a frown.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Blow me if I’m stuck on the job, though, Edge!”
he went on in a petulant tone.</p>

<p class='c002'>The fat fellow’s smooth forehead puckered anxiously.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s the matter?” he asked quickly. “Not getting
cold feet, I hope.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, it’s not that,” Carr exclaimed; “but the boy is
such a decent fellow and thinks I’m all to the good. I
feel like a snake when I think of what I’m trying to
bring about. If Yale loses, it will be blamed on him,
in a way. Why, I believe the fellow really likes me!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Tut, tut!” clucked Edgerton impatiently. “Never
let your sympathies get control. It’s better not to
have any; but if you must, why, keep them under, Clarence—keep
them under. We’ve got to pull this
through, or where will we be? Don’t let’s have any
more talk like that. What’s the boy to you, anyhow?
You’ll never see him again.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, I suppose not,” Carr said petulantly. “But I
can’t help feeling the way I do. Don’t worry, though.
I’m not going to back out. I can’t afford to. That
last slump in the Street left me high and dry. But if
it wasn’t for that I’d never put my hand to a dirty deal
like this.”</p>

<p class='c002'>An expression flashed across the fat fellow’s face
which was far from cherubic.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Cut it out, Clarence,” he snapped; “cut it out!
Stop thinking about it, or the whole thing will slump.
Take a brace, for goodness sake! There’s nothing to
be so squeamish about. You’ve been in lots worse
things than this.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I know that,” returned the broker quickly. “Don’t
worry, I tell you. I’m not going to back out. I’ve
simply got to follow it through to the end, or we’ll
both be stony.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The placid look returned to Edgerton’s countenance
and, with a sigh of relief, he picked up his glass and
drained it.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That’s right,” he murmured, setting it down;
“that’s sensible. And now about the bets. When can
we start placing them? That’s where my work begins,
and I don’t want to be losing valuable time. How
about to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Better wait until Thursday,” Carr returned
thoughtfully. “That’ll give you plenty of time, and
I’ll be able to see how things go on the field to-morrow
afternoon. Of course, they won’t let me watch the
practice, but I can sound Kenny afterward. I’ve got
him now so he loosens up and confides everything to
me.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, Thursday it is, then,” chuckled Edgerton,
his good humor quite restored. “That’ll give me
two full days to make a killing in New York, and
Saturday morning to do a little placing here. Let’s
have another drink. Same for you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The broker nodded, and Edgerton struck the bell
sharply. The high balls were ordered and swiftly
brought. By the time Carr had finished, his life took on
a rosier hue. His momentary scruples had quite vanished,
and he flung himself into the game with renewed
zest, laying out an effective campaign for the morrow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE BREACH WIDENS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Dick Merriwell appeared on the athletic field the
next afternoon in a somewhat anxious state of mind.
After the straight talk he had given Tempest the day
before, and his subsequent interview with Kenny, he
hoped that things would go smoothly, but he knew that
nothing was ever certain.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was too good a judge of character to imagine
that a mere quarter of an hour’s talk, no matter how
emphatic it was, could be the means of changing utterly
the methods and point of view of a fellow like
Tempest. He felt sure that the captain of the varsity
would do his best to follow the advice which had been
given him, but whether he would succeed was quite another
matter.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had less anxiety in regard to Kenny. He felt
that the quarter back was sincere in his desire to have
peace and harmony in the team, and after their talk
last night he was sure that the hot-tempered, good-hearted
chap would even put up with a little of Tempest’s
nagging without breaking out again.</p>

<p class='c002'>But, strangely enough, the practice had barely begun,
before he found prevailing a condition which
was quite the opposite from what he had confidently
supposed would be the case.</p>

<p class='c002'>Almost at once he perceived that Tempest had a
firm grip on himself and was doing his best to preserve
harmony, whereas Kenny acted as if he had a chip
on his shoulder which he was almost anxious for the
captain to knock off.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was as nearly sullen as such a naturally good-tempered
fellow could be, taking his part in the game
in a perfunctory manner without his usual snap and
vim; and, instead of going ahead on his own hook
with the various plays which had to be practiced, he
was constantly pausing and asking Tempest’s advice in
a pointed, sarcastic manner which would have driven
anybody wild.</p>

<p class='c002'>Naturally the latter got hot under the collar. Here
he was straining every effort to keep the peace, and
Kenny, instead of meeting him halfway, was doing
his best to aggravate him and provoke a verbal battle.</p>

<p class='c002'>The result was that, before an hour had passed, the
two were at daggers’ points, and a feeling of unrest
and uneasiness had come over the whole team, which
seriously interfered with its efficiency, and prevented
it from doing anything like the good work it should
have done.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell was puzzled as well as decidedly angry.
What in the world possessed Kenny? What had come
over him since their talk of the previous evening, when
the quarter back had shown such a very evident and
sincere desire to see things go well, and, more than
that, had promised that he would do his best to that
end.</p>

<p class='c002'>Instead of keeping his word, he had gone to quite
the opposite extreme and was very evidently bent on
rousing Tempest to a fury. Merriwell could not understand
it, and he was so angry with the little quarter
back that it would have given him the greatest
pleasure to take the sulky fellow by the shoulders and
shake him, as one would a spoiled child.</p>

<p class='c002'>Luckily Tempest refused to be dragged into a verbal
encounter. It was evident to him that Kenny was deliberately
working to that end, and, his blood aroused,
the captain strained every effort to keep a grip on
himself. It was one of the hardest things he ever did.
His words grew sharp and snappy, his face flushed and
angry; but he tried to ignore the quarter back, and
managed to get through the afternoon without an open
clash.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick saw all this with regret, and, also, with an infinite
admiration for Tempest’s surprising self-control;
and, as soon as the practice was over, he stepped to the
captain’s side.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That was bully, Don,” he said, in a low tone. “You
held in splendidly. But that little rat ought to be
turned up and spanked. I never saw anything so aggravating
in my life.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Aggravating!” foamed Tempest, who, now that
he was alone with Merriwell, gave full vent to his fury.
“Aggravating isn’t the word for it! By thunder, Dick,
it was all I could do to keep my hands off the little
devil! I wouldn’t go through another afternoon like
this for a thousand dollars!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell’s face wore a puzzled look.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I can’t think what’s got into him,” he said thoughtfully.
“I had a long talk with him last night, and he
promised to stop his foolishness and behave himself.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“And you see how he’s kept that promise!” Tempest
said bitterly. “He’s worse than I ever knew him to be.
Honestly, old fellow, I can’t go on this way. I’d go
off my nut. Look here, Dick, let me hand in my resignation
and you take my place. You can pull things
together and do something with them. They’ll do
anything you want them to, but if I try to stick it out
Heaven knows what will happen. Another day like
this and they’ll all be up in open rebellion.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great Scott, man!” Dick cried aghast. “Why,
you’re crazy! The idea of changing captains at such
a time as this! It couldn’t be done, even if I’d consider
it—which I won’t for a minute. You’ve got to
keep on, Don, and pull things through. And we’ve
got to win that game Saturday. It would be better
for Kenny to go than you, but we can’t afford to lose
either of you. You must stick it out, old fellow. I’ll
see Jack again and give him fits. He’s got something
on his mind which wasn’t there last night, and I mean
to find out what it is.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without delay he proceeded to the track house
and hustled into his other clothes. He couldn’t tackle
the quarter back in the midst of the crowd who
thronged the place, but he meant to catch him as he
was leaving.</p>

<p class='c002'>Quick as he was, however, he barely managed to get
into his things before he saw his man hurrying out of
the door.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Jack!” he called, snatching up his overcoat and hat.
“Wait a minute.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny turned rather reluctantly. It almost seemed
as if he wanted to avoid Merriwell, but the latter did
not propose to let him get away.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What’s your hurry?” he inquired, as he joined the
other outside the door.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Oh, nothing,” returned Kenny, his eyes averted.
“I just wanted to get back to the dorm, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c002'>They were out in the street by this time, and, as
they turned and walked along the high board fence,
Dick looked his companion squarely in the face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What in the mischief has got into you, Jack?” he
asked quickly. “You told me you’d behave, and yet
you’ve acted like a perfect kid all afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny hesitated.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I can’t stand that Tempest!” he burst out the next
moment. “He makes me daft.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Makes you daft,” repeated Dick. “Why, you’re
the one who makes him, and all the rest of us, hot,
going around with a sour face and a chip on your
shoulder. If I’d been Don I’d have felt like giving
you a good thrashing. You never gave him a chance
to be decent.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The quarter back looked a little sheepish.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I knew he couldn’t be,” he returned quickly, “so I
just got in my licks first. I thought I’d give him a
dose of his own medicine and see how he liked it.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You little idiot!” Merriwell retorted. “Do you
know what you’re going to do if you keep on this
way? You’re going to lose the game for us Saturday.
If you can’t take a brace, we’ll be licked as sure as
fate, and there won’t be a person to blame for it but
yourself.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny’s face flushed and he made a quick, dissenting
motion with one hand.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Look here, Dick,” he protested. “That’s putting
it pretty strong, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s a fact,” Merriwell returned emphatically.</p>

<p class='c002'>His words seemed to sober Kenny and bring him to
a partial realization of the gravity of the situation.
All the way back to the campus Dick kept up his argument,
and by the time they got off the car at Church
and High Streets he had brought the quarter back
into a contrite and fairly repentant frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c002'>At the same time, it seemed to him that Kenny was
not so pliable as he had been the night before. It had
been harder to bring him to a realization of the error
of his ways. Somehow, Dick felt almost as if there
was a counter influence which was pulling against his
own—something which was encouraging Kenny in his
rebellion and egging him on in the disagreement with
Tempest.</p>

<p class='c002'>What it could be he could not imagine. Who among
the quarter back’s friends or acquaintances could encourage
him in his fatal folly? For any sane person
must realize that if the fellow persisted in his course
a victory on Saturday would be seriously imperiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>He was turning this over in his mind all through
supper, and afterward, walking along Church Street
with Brad, Keran, and several others, it was still puzzling
him.</p>

<p class='c002'>All at once his eyes fell on Kenny himself, walking
down the street on the other side, in earnest conversation
with a slim, brisk man of about thirty.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Who’s that fellow with Kenny?” he asked quickly.</p>

<p class='c002'>They all glanced over the way, and Phil Keran answered
the question.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Clarence Carr,” he said readily. “He’s Archie
Carr’s brother. He came in to see me the other night,
and Kenny met him there. Nice chap, too. Crazy
about football. He played at Brown. He and Jack
seem to hit it off pretty well.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick took in the man with a swift, appraising glance.
He remembered Archie Carr perfectly as a good football
player and red-hot Yale man. There was absolutely
no reason why he should question his brother’s
loyalty and integrity, but still a tiny germ of doubt
was generated in his mind at that moment—something
which sprang into being quite without rhyme or reason,
and which persisted in remaining despite its seeming
absurdity and incongruity.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br /><span class='small'>IN DESPERATE STRAITS.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Twenty-four hours later Dick Merriwell was confident
that some malign influence was at work on Jack
Kenny’s mind combating his own strenuous efforts to
bring about concord between him and Don Tempest.
Some one was doing his level best to keep the quarter
back constantly stirred up in his ire against the captain
of the varsity, so that it required every bit of
Merriwell’s patience and perseverance to prevent an
open break.</p>

<p class='c002'>He had arrived at this conclusion simply from a
keen sense of observation. He knew Jack Kenny well
enough to be perfectly sure that he was not the sort
of fellow to harbor a grudge to the extent which he
was fostering this one. He was a man who would be
apt to flare up in a swift outburst of wrath, but it was
not at all like him to develop this sullen, sneering,
backbiting streak which had been apparent for the past
few days.</p>

<p class='c002'>Some one must be egging him on; some one was deliberately
encouraging him to combat Tempest at every
possible point; and that person must be going about his
underhand work with amazing skill and forethought.
His method of procedure must be so insidious that
Kenny himself had no idea he was being worked; for
at no time did Dick question for an instant the quarter
back’s loyalty to his team or to his college.</p>

<p class='c002'>Who this some one was, Merriwell had no idea. It
must be a man who either had a personal grudge
against Tempest himself, or else had some vital reason
for bringing about an open rupture in the Yale
team before the great contest of the season.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick could not close his eyes to the fact that this
last condition of affairs was in a fair way to be brought
about unless something speedily intervened to prevent
it. Little by little the fellows had been taking sides in
the unfortunate disagreement between the captain and
the quarter back.</p>

<p class='c002'>The strain of having to keep a constant watch on
his tongue was beginning to tell on Tempest and
showed in a loosening of the grip he had on the team
and a resulting decrease in its efficiency.</p>

<p class='c002'>Quick to notice this, many of the fellows blamed it
altogether upon Tempest. They began to question his
ability among themselves and wonder whether his
methods were right and whether he was going to lead
them to victory on Saturday.</p>

<p class='c002'>Doubt and hesitation and suspicion were rife on
all sides. It would take but the merest breath to add
discouragement to their number; and once a team
starts in with a doubt as to its ability to win the handicap
against it is tremendous.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell did his best to instill encouragement and
hope into their failing spirits, but, under the peculiar
condition of affairs, he was almost helpless to do any
good in that line. Kenny had started the ball rolling,
and he was the only one who could stop its progress.
If he could only be brought to his senses and grant
to Tempest his cheerful, willing obedience and coöperation,
the trouble might possibly be stopped.</p>

<p class='c002'>Men would see that his confidence in the captain was
restored, and, in their turn, might be inspired to renewed
hope and consequent endeavor.</p>

<p class='c002'>To this end, therefore, Dick bent every effort; but
he was unsuccessful. Kenny listened to his words,
but was not convinced; and Merriwell knew that some
one else was working against him.</p>

<p class='c002'>By Friday night he was almost certain that this
some one was Clarence Carr, who, for the past few
days, had been spending every possible moment in the
company of the quarter back. He was the only unknown
quantity among Kenny’s acquaintance. The
others were all beyond reproach, and at last, incredible
as the thought was, Dick became convinced that Carr
was doing his very utmost to bring about a rupture in
the Yale team, so that Harvard would gain the victory.</p>

<p class='c002'>What the broker’s motive was he could not guess.
There were a dozen reasons why he might wish to
bring such a thing about, and Dick did not waste much
time over that. The great thing was to convince
Kenny that Carr was meddling, and that he had an
ulterior motive for wishing the defeat of Yale; and
this was almost impossible.</p>

<p class='c002'>The man’s manner was frank and open. He spoke
enthusiastically of Yale’s chances for victory, even offering
to lay a little money on the blue. He referred
often, though with apparent casualness, to his brother’s
intimate connection with the university, and with
football; and more than once he had been heard to
wish that he had taken his degree at New Haven instead
of Providence.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick easily found an opportunity of meeting him;
for he seemed to have no friends in town except the
college boys, with whom he had grown to be rather
popular. He found the fellow a keen, shrewd man of
the world, likewise an interesting and amusing talker,
and possessed of a certain degree of attractiveness. It
seemed almost incredible that such a man as he—polished,
refined, and gentlemanly—could stoop to the
underhand methods which Merriwell suspected. And
yet, if he were not to blame for influencing Kenny,
who was?</p>

<p class='c002'>Having met Carr, Merriwell realized full well the
utter impossibility of convincing the quarter back of
his double-dealing, without absolute proof. And
where was he to get that proof, when all he had to go
by was his own intuition?</p>

<p class='c002'>Supper on Friday night was a dismal meal. The
practice that afternoon had been particularly dispiriting
and lacking in vim and go. Fullerton had bellowed
himself hoarse and had been reduced to open wrath at
the wretched showing made by many of the team.
Don Tempest, white-faced and with set teeth, had
struggled desperately to prevent himself giving way to
a furious outburst of rage at the aggravating Kenny,
who seemed even more possessed of the devil than
usual.</p>

<p class='c002'>Everything seemed to be at sixes and sevens, and
it was scarcely to be wondered that gloomy, discouraged
faces were the rule that night, as the fellows
thought of what the morrow might bring forth and
groaned inwardly.</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell, Buckhart, and one or two others tried to
combat the persistent gloom, but without avail. They,
themselves, were not feeling any too sure about things,
and their cheering words were not of the most convincing
order.</p>

<p class='c002'>Consequently, the meal went on to a silent finish;
and then, as chairs were pushed back, and the men
arose, Tempest stopped them with a quick gesture.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just a minute, fellows,” he said, in a low tone.
“There’ll be a short meeting of the team and subs in
the gym at eight o’clock. Please be there, all of you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>At Merriwell’s suggestion there was to be a last
effort made to rally the failing spirits of the men
and make them realize how grave was the situation.
It was all he could think of at the moment, and he
meant to take the floor himself and bring all his power
of eloquence to bear to try and brace them up. But,
first, he intended to have another whack at Kenny and
see if by hook or crook he couldn’t bring him to his
senses.</p>

<p class='c002'>“If I could only prove something against that traitor,
Carr,” he said to himself, as he crossed the campus
with Brad.</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly he gave a start.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By Jove!” he exclaimed aloud. “I might try that!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Try what?” inquired Buckhart. “What are you
talking about, anyhow, pard?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Nothing much,” Merriwell answered, as he quickened
his pace. “I was just thinking.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He did not speak another word until they reached
the rooms. The moment the door was closed he dashed
into the closet, and, fumbling around for a few minutes
in the dark, presently emerged with an armful of
clothes and a flat, oblong box.</p>

<p class='c002'>With wondering eyes the Texan watched him
swiftly strip off his suit and array himself in the one
he had resurrected from the depths of the closet. With
ever-growing curiosity, he saw his chum open the box
and take out a jar of cold cream and some sticks of
grease paints. Then he could contain himself no
longer.</p>

<p class='c002'>“What in thunder are you up to now?” he exploded.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m going to make a last effort to bring that little
idiot Kenny around,” he replied. “If it succeeds, I’ll
tell you all about it. If it don’t——”</p>

<p class='c002'>He finished the sentence with a shrug of his shoulders
and caught up a stick of grease paint. Brad’s
face was a picture of bewilderment as he watched the
rapid transformation going on before his eyes. A
touch here, a line there, worked wonders. Some false
eyebrows, skillfully attached, made the disguise still
more perfect.</p>

<p class='c002'>At last, throwing down the hand glass in which he
had been inspecting the whole effect, Dick snatched
up a disreputable derby from the chair, and, clapping
it on his head, tore open the door and disappeared, leaving
his chum staring at the closed portal in a dazed
fashion.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, I’ll—be—hanged!” he exclaimed presently.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>DICK MAKES A DISCOVERY.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>J. Harry Edgerton had spent such a busy day in
town that he missed the Merchants’ Limited and was
obliged to take the 5:30 train from the Grand Central,
which did not get him to New Haven until after
seven. It was, in fact, exactly twenty-five minutes
past when he stepped out of the cab at the entrance to
the New Haven House and made his way leisurely into
the lobby.</p>

<p class='c002'>As his smiling, cherubic countenance loomed like a
full moon in the doorway, Clarence Carr, who had
been waiting impatiently for some time, stepped quickly
forward.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well!” he said, rather shortly, “I expected you an
hour ago, at the latest. What under the sun kept you
so long?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Patience, my sweet Dromio,” gurgled the fat fellow,
with a pacifying wave of his hand. “Don’t fly at
me like an angry cat. All is well. Better than we
hoped for, in fact. But let us lubricate. I cannot—simply
cannot—orate in my present parched condition
of throat. It feels like the desert of Sahara—I give
you my word it does.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The broker’s face relaxed considerably.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Well, come along, then,” he returned. “I could
manage one or two myself.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He linked his arm with that of Edgerton, and together
they passed into the bar and took their seats at
one of the small tables. An attendant was quickly summoned
and brought glasses, bottles, and a siphon.
Then he withdrew, leaving them on the table at a
sign from Edgerton.</p>

<p class='c002'>Two high balls were mixed and promptly swallowed.
Then J. Harry leaned back in his chair with a contented
sigh and took a comprehensive survey of the
room.</p>

<p class='c002'>There were half a dozen men congregated at the
other end of the bar, while farther along, at a point
nearly opposite their table, a rather seedy individual,
with flushed face and dented derby, had just slouched
in and ordered gin. The stout gentleman saw the
drink poured out, with a grimace of disgust.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Pah!” he exclaimed. “Such a coarse drink, and so
extremely deleterious to the lining of the stomach!
Never indulge in crude gin, Clarence. That fellow is
half seas over as it is. He’ll be put out directly.”</p>

<p class='c002'>He watched the man drain his glass at a swallow and
barely touch his lips with the chaser. Then, dismissing
the fellow from his mind, he returned to the matter in
hand, first, however, mixing himself another high ball,
which he consumed in leisurely sips while he talked.</p>

<p class='c002'>He would have been somewhat astonished had he
known that the object of his criticism at the bar had
performed a swift substitution of the glasses under his
very eye, and, instead of drinking the gin, he had swallowed
the chaser; and presently, when his order was
repeated, the full glass of gin was dumped into the
slops by the bartender under the impression that it
was water, and another glassful poured out.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Splendid success,” Edgerton chuckled. “I laid out
every cent I could beg, borrow, or steal, at bully odds.
I should say about two thousand odd, including everything.
Now, if you’ve only done your part as well,
we’ll be in Easy Street this time to-morrow night.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Carr’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great!” he exclaimed. “Don’t be afraid, Edge.
I’ve got things fixed so that the whole team is at loggerheads.
I’ve worked Kenny every minute I could
be with him, and kept that grouch of his nursed as if
it was a precious hothouse flower. The poor fool has
never suspected me for an instant. Thinks I have a
sweetly sympathetic nature. I think there’s hardly a
doubt that we’ll win out, and then for another try at
that game of the Bluebell mining stock.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Edgerton chuckled, and raised the glass to his lips.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Good! We’ll place a few little bets here and there
to-morrow among the confiding village people, providing,
of course, they don’t insist on being shown the
coin. Altogether, it ought to be a pretty nice little
rake-off.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The man at the bar seemed to have had enough gin.
With unsteady gait and leering eye, he passed the table
and made his way toward the door. As he reached it,
he caught his foot and nearly fell. The next moment
he had lurched out into the darkness.</p>

<p class='c002'>On the pavement outside a surprising transformation
took place. The fellow straightened up suddenly,
and, with a sweep of his hand, pushed his hat up from
where it hung over one ear. Then he started down the
street at a rapid walk, which was almost a run.
There was not the slightest sign of intoxication in his
gait.</p>

<p class='c002'>“By Jove!” he muttered. “That’s their game, is it?
Thank Heaven I’ve found it out! What a pair of
blacklegs!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He glanced swiftly at a near-by clock. It was almost
eight.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Gee!” he exclaimed, under his breath. “I’ve got to
catch him before he leaves for the meeting.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The next instant he turned into one of the gates of
Vanderbilt, dashed up the drive, and cleared the steps
at a bound. Upstairs he went, lickety-split, and
reached Kenny’s floor just as the quarter back opened
the door and stepped out.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Wait a minute, Jack,” he said quickly. “I’ve got
something to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“The deuce you have!” Kenny growled. “Who in
thunder are you, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c002'>For an instant Dick had forgotten the disguise. No
wonder the quarter back didn’t know him!</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s Merriwell,” he said, smiling. “Quick! Give
me a towel and some water. I’ll get rid of this stuff
while we talk. I’ve got my cold-cream jar in my
pocket.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Pushing the bewildered Kenny before him, he entered
the room and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Hustle, boy!” he exclaimed. “A wet towel first,
and then we’ll go at the other.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Still dazed, but under the influence of Dick’s dominating
personality, Kenny brought the moistened towel,
which Merriwell snatched from his hands. Already he
had rubbed cold cream over his face. With the first
vigorous rub off came the eyebrows and most of the
paint. Kenny gasped as the familiar face of his friend
appeared swiftly and strangely. Then Dick plunged
into his story, for there was no time to lose.</p>

<p class='c002'>“This Clarence Carr,” he began rapidly; “you’ve
been pretty chummy with him lately, haven’t you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny looked astonished.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, he’s been in to see me several——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Exactly,” Dick cut in. “Talked football a lot, didn’t
he? Said you were being badly used on the team, I’ll
bet? Perhaps he said you should have been captain?”</p>

<p class='c002'>The quarter back’s jaw dropped at this volley of
questions. A rush of color stained his face.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Why, how—how—did you——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Never mind how I found out,” Dick flashed back.
“Jack, he’s a crooked scoundrel! He’s been egging you
on to buck against Tempest for the sole purpose of
ruining the team and giving the game to Harvard.”</p>

<p class='c002'>The flush died out of Kenny’s face, leaving it pale
and set. His eyes flashed indignantly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How dare you say that, Merriwell?” he exclaimed
angrily. “He couldn’t do such a thing. Why, his own
brother went to Yale and played on the varsity!”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I know all that, but it’s true just the same,” Dick
flung back. “Would you believe it if you knew he and
a pal of his had put up over two thousand dollars on
Harvard?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“But how could he?” expostulated the quarter back.
“He’s crazy for us to win. He’s even——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I know all that,” Merriwell returned swiftly; “but
this very night—not ten minutes ago—I heard the
truth from his very lips. He was talking over it with
his pal in the bar of the New Haven House. I was
there, made up this way. I had suspected him before.
They didn’t know me, of course. The bets were all
placed in New York. They’re no better than a couple
of crooks. Listen!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Swiftly, a little brokenly, but quite clearly, he poured
into Kenny’s ears the story of what he had discovered.
The quarter back’s face was pale and his eyes horror-stricken
when the brief recital was finished. For an instant
he could not speak.</p>

<p class='c002'>“His very words,” repeated Dick. “I’ve worked
Kenny every minute I could be with him, and kept that
grouch of his nursed as if it was a precious hothouse
flower. The poor fool never suspected me for an instant.
Thinks I have a sweetly sympathetic nature.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly the slim fellow’s face grew purple.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Blazes!” he almost shouted. “The thundering,
double-faced liar! I’ll smash up that face of his so his
own brother won’t know him! I’m going down there
this minute. I don’t care where he is.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without waiting to pick up his hat, he started toward
the door, his fists clenched and his eyes wild with
rage. Dick caught his arm in a grip of iron.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Stop, Jack!” he said sternly. “You’ve got something
more important than that to do.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny struggled to release his arm.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Let me go, Dick!” he pleaded. “The dirty scoundrel
used me! I’ve got to——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’ve got to come to the gym with me,” Merriwell
broke in swiftly. “You’ve got to set things right
with Tempest. The fellows are all in a blue funk because
of what you’ve done. They don’t believe in Don
any more, and you’ve got to make them believe. I
don’t care what you do to this sneak after to-morrow,
but until then your duty is to Yale. I tell you, Jack,
the very game is at stake, and you’re the only man who
can stir the fellows up and give them back the confidence
in Tempest which you have taken away. Perhaps
it’s too late now. I don’t know, but you’ve got
to try.”</p>

<p class='c002'>While he was speaking, Kenny’s face grew calmer,
and into his eyes crept a look which was like fear.
What if he had spoiled Yale’s chances for victory by
his idiotic behavior? What if it were too late for
reparation? A bitter pang, sharp as a dagger point,
pierced him to the heart. He saw himself branded as
a traitor to the <i>alma mater</i> which he loved so well, and
for whose success he would have willingly given up his
last breath. The thought sobered him like a dash of
icy water and made him forget everything but the desperate
need for reviving the drooping spirits of the
team and restoring their confidence in Don Tempest,
the man he had wronged.</p>

<p class='c002'>The quarter back ceased his struggles instantly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re right, Dick,” he said, in a strained voice.
“I’ve been a blind, beastly fool; but I understand now.
I’ll do my best to straighten things out with the boys.
It can’t be too late—it simply can’t!”</p>

<p class='c002'>He looked imploringly at Merriwell, whose face was
very serious.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I hope not,” the latter said soberly. “Lost confidence
is a pretty hard thing to restore, sometimes but
we’ve got to do it to-night. Come, let’s hurry.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Without a word, Kenny snatched up his hat,
switched off the light, and together the two hastened
down the stairs and out into the street.</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXX<br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE MORNING OF THE GAME.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>Breakfast at the training table the next morning was
a strange meal, to which the fellows loitered in at whatever
hour best pleased them. Many showed signs of
restless slumber, and the trainer was as watchful as an
old hen with a brood of chickens.</p>

<p class='c002'>The principal topic of conversation was the surprising
shift about at the meeting last night on the part of
Jack Kenny. He and Merriwell had appeared in the
gym so late that some of the fellows were about to
sally forth and hunt them up. They saw at once
that he was very much wrought up and excited, though
Merriwell seemed as calm and steady as usual.</p>

<p class='c002'>After the meeting was called to order, the quarter
back got on his feet and made a really impassioned
speech in which he acknowledged what a fool he had
been in questioning for a moment Tempest’s ability
as captain, then besought the fellows to forget how he
had been behaving for the past week and do their best
to pull things through to-morrow.</p>

<p class='c002'>There was no doubt of his earnestness and sincerity,
and great was the speculation as to what had happened
to bring about the change of heart. Many laid it to
Merriwell, but no one could be certain; for Kenny
made no explanation beyond acknowledging that he
had been in the wrong.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick followed him with a few well-chosen, emphatic
words, in which he pointed out the need of organized
teamwork, and cautioned every man to put aside all
thoughts of personal glory and work with all his might
for Yale.</p>

<p class='c002'>His tone was hopeful and encouraging. He did not
allow the fellows to think for an instant that he had
any doubts of their ultimate success, and the results
of the meeting were distinctly for the better.</p>

<p class='c002'>Notwithstanding this, however, there were many
signs of nervousness and unrest the following morning.
There always are on the day of a great game. Men
who never give a thought of their ability to win out
at any other time are seized with all sorts of absurd
doubts and fears when the crucial moment is so near at
hand, which luckily vanish the instant they line up
on the field. It is only the long, anxious period of
waiting which is so trying.</p>

<p class='c002'>Those who had Saturday morning recitations attended
them, though it is quite safe to say that they
were little benefited thereby. The others were sent out
to the field, where they went through a short, brisk
signal practice.</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny showed up splendidly at this, and, as Dick
watched him, he wished to Heaven that he might have
been brought to his senses before the eleventh hour.
It would have been so much better in every way. For
Merriwell could not help but feel a certain amount of
worry and uneasiness as to how the men would show
up in the afternoon. Though he preserved a smiling
face and confident demeanor, he was inwardly not a
little doubtful of results. He knew, better, perhaps,
than any one else, how difficult it is to restore confidence
once lost. Kenny’s awakening had had a good
effect, but whether it would prove a lasting one time
alone would show.</p>

<p class='c002'>So much depended on how the game went at the
start, and he resolved to strain every effort to prevent
Harvard from scoring in the first quarter.</p>

<p class='c002'>The short practice over, the fellows trotted a few
times about the gridiron and then returned to the
campus, where they wandered about, awaiting the arrival
of the Harvard boys, who were momentarily expected.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick was detained by a consultation with Fullerton
and Tempest, which took place in his rooms. He did
not, in fact, realize how the time had flown, and was
consequently surprised when the door was burst open
unceremoniously and his old friend Dale Sparkfair,
now captain of the Harvard varsity, rushed into the
room.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Richard, my boy, how are you?” he exclaimed, advancing
with outstretched hands. “You’re a sight
for sore eyes!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick’s face lit up with pleasure as he gripped Sparkfair’s
fingers.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Great, old fellow,” he smiled. “How’s yourself?
Haven’t seen you since that day last summer on the
lake when we had a pick-up game of ball.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“And you came so blamed near being licked,” the
Harvard man put in. “You were pretty bad, that day,
old man. So very punky that I got careless and let
you in. Of course, had I been in my usual form, such
a thing would never have happened. I hope you’re
prepared for a drubbing this afternoon? Despite my
native modesty, I am forced to admit that we have collected
such a team as Harvard—or, I may say, any
other college—never before turned out.”</p>

<p class='c002'>His blue eyes were mirthful and his lips curved in a
smile.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dick laughed.</p>

<p class='c002'>“It’s a shame to disappoint you, but we’ve just about
made up our minds to take the trick ourselves. You
know Tempest and Fullerton, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Dale turned and shook hands with the two men.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Sure thing,” he said. “Met Tempest last year, and
everybody knows old Bill. So you think you’re going
to do us? What a shock you’ll have. It almost makes
me sad to think of it. The Philistines may walk up
and down the earth, puffing out their chests and making
a mighty noise of brazen trumpets, but great will be
their fall. <i>Timothy</i>, tenth-sixteenth.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Same old fake Scripture quoting,” Dick smiled.
“Stolen from Blessed Jones, too. One would never
suppose you were such a religious duck to look at you,
Spark.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Many of my best qualities are kept hidden from the
vulgar eye,” Dale returned airily. “Say, I hear you
boys have doped out a great line of tricks. Got something
up your sleeves for us, have you?”</p>

<p class='c002'>“We have,” Dick said promptly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You don’t say! What’s the nature of it, if I may
ask? Perhaps you object to putting me wise, though.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“No objection whatever,” Dick answered gravely.
“It’s muscle.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Aren’t you the cute thing!” grinned Sparkfair.
“Never mind. You’re safe to get licked, secret or no
secret. Where’s that bucking broncho of a Buckhart?
I’d like to shake his big paw.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Down on the campus somewhere,” Dick answered.
“We’ll go down and look him up. We’re all through
here.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“Plots, I suppose,” Dale remarked, glancing from
Tempest to Fullerton. “Too bad, but they won’t do
you a particle of good.”</p>
<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c001' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c009'>CHAPTER XXXI<br /> <br /><span class='small'>ON THE FIELD.</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c010'>High up against a fair blue sky, studded with fleecy
clouds, streamed a mammoth banner of blue bearing in
its centre a great white Y—a flare of intense color
visible from afar over the topmost branches of the empty
elms, and a beacon toward which the stream of
spectators set their steps.</p>

<p class='c002'>Derby Avenue was filled from curb to curb with a
slowly moving procession of motor cars, horse-drawn
vehicles of all kinds, street cars, loaded to the very
steps with a laughing, chattering mob of humanity, all
making their way toward the athletic field.</p>

<p class='c002'>As two o’clock approached, the throngs at the gates
moved faster, swaying and pushing past the ticket
takers and streaming out onto the field toward the
stands already piled high with enthusiastic humanity.
Under the great flag stretched a long bank of somber
grays and blacks, brightened here and there by lighter
feminine apparel, and everywhere was a multitude of
smaller fluttering flags of blue, which looked from
a little distance as if the big banner had dripped its dye
upon the crowd beneath.</p>

<p class='c002'>Violets were everywhere. Great masses of them
pinned upon the tailor-made coats of charming, eager
girls. Smaller bunches in the buttonholes of their
escorts; and their perfume wafted out over the field,
filled the air with a sweet, penetrating odor which was
far more like that of a day in June than one in brisk,
blustering late November.</p>

<p class='c002'>Opposite, the rival tiers of crowded seats were
picked out in vivid crimson, and between stretched a
smooth expanse of russet-hued turf, ribbed with white
lines that glared in the afternoon sun.</p>

<p class='c002'>The great band played blithely; the thousands of
eager spectators talked, laughed, or shouted ceaselessly;
and the cheering sections were loudly contending
for vocal supremacy.</p>

<p class='c002'>Suddenly onto the field trotted a little band of men
in blue sweaters with white Y’s; and quite as suddenly
the Yale stands arose and the Harvard cheers were
blotted out by a mighty chorus that swept from end to
end of the structure and thundered impressively across
the field.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yale! Yale! Yale! Rah, rah, rah! Rah, rah,
rah! Rah, rah, rah! Yale! Yale! Yale!”</p>

<p class='c002'>It was repeated over and over again, and then the
crimson-clad youths trotted into view and it was Harvard’s
turn to make a noise.</p>

<p class='c002'>The substitutes of both teams retired to the side
lines, and the players who were to start the game
warmed up. The cheering on the stands gave place to
songs which drowned the music of the band, until, at
length, three persons, a youth in blue, a youth in crimson,
and a man in everyday attire, met in the middle
of the field and watched a coin spin upward in the sunlight
and fall to the ground.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then swiftly the contending forces took their positions,
the linesmen and timekeeper hurried forward
and the great stands were almost stilled.</p>

<p class='c002'>Yale had the ball and the west goal. Baulsir placed
the pigskin to his liking and drew back. Tempest
shouted a last word of warning. The referee raised
his whistle.</p>

<p class='c002'>The next instant it sounded shrilly, the ball sped
away, and the game began.</p>

<p class='c002'>Within the first five minutes it became evident to the
excited thousands that the game was to be a desperate
struggle from start to finish. Sparkfair had not been
altogether jesting when he told Merriwell that his
team was the best which had ever been turned out at
Cambridge. What little they lacked in weight, compared
with the brawny Yale line, they made up in
cleverness and teamwork, and they played the game
from the beginning with a snap and vim which was a
joy to see.</p>

<p class='c002'>Yale was not noticeably behind them. Animated by
the contagious optimism of Merriwell, Buckhart, and
some of the older players, they met the rush of the
crimson line like a wall of rock and contested every
foot of advance.</p>

<p class='c002'>Jack Kenny was doing wonders. Thrilled by the
necessity of making up for the harm he had wrought
unconsciously, he played for all that was in him, and
the result was an exhibition of brilliant headwork and
resource such as is seldom seen.</p>

<p class='c002'>Back and forth surged the lines of men. Now and
then one side or the other would bring into play some
unexpected, spectacular stunt which drew forth shouts
of delight from the stands and gave them the momentary
advantage, only to have their opponents retaliate
in kind.</p>

<p class='c002'>The first quarter passed without either side scoring.
The crowds were wild with excitement, and during the
brief three-minute pause they cheered themselves
hoarse and nearly stamped the grand stands down in
their efforts to show their enthusiastic appreciation.</p>

<p class='c002'>At the beginning of the second quarter Harvard
rushed the ball down the field in a determined, irresistible
effort to score. They were opposed with equal determination,
and the battle was on again.</p>

<p class='c002'>Back and forth, back and forth surged the lines.
Now one side had the advantage and then the other.
At length, Kenny tried the much-practiced double pass
with Baxter and Merriwell on Harvard’s thirty-yard
line, and it worked.</p>

<p class='c002'>Swiftly the pigskin flew through the air into Teddy
Baxter’s waiting arms. Without a pause he dashed
on, crossing behind Merriwell, shooting out into the
field around the end, guarded by Crowfoot and Blair
Hildebrand. The crimson line plunged forward and
to the left, sure of their man.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then, like a flash of light, the ball flew from Baxter
into the waiting arms of Merriwell, and Teddy
lunged to block their opponent’s guard, while Dick
kept on without a pause toward the goal.</p>

<p class='c002'>He made it, and the spectators on the Yale stand
went wild. It was the first moment since the start of
the game that the tension had been released, and, surging
to their feet, they sent roar after roar of cheering
which thundered across the field in great crashes
of sound, stupendous in their volume.</p>

<p class='c002'>Then came a breathless hush while the goal was being
kicked, and after that the noise commenced again,
dying away gradually as the game was resumed.</p>

<p class='c002'>Nothing more happened in that quarter. The crimson-clad
men, undeterred by their opponents’ vantage,
worked like tigers; but there was not enough time left
for them to accomplish anything, and the shrill sound
of the whistle left them on Yale’s forty-yard line.</p>

<p class='c002'>“How about it, Dale?” Dick asked, as he passed the
Harvard captain on their way to the track house.</p>

<p class='c002'>Sparkfair grinned cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That was only my generous spirit giving you boys
a little needed encouragement,” he returned airily.
“Wait until the next quarter, Richard, and see us wipe
up the field with you fellows. We’re only just beginning
to get warmed up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Merriwell caught up with Jack Kenny, who was a
little ahead.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That was corking, Jack,” he said warmly. “You
rang that double pass in at exactly the right moment.
They weren’t expecting it, and it couldn’t have worked
better. Keep it up, old fellow. You’re playing the
game of your life.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m trying to make up,” he said, in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c002'>“And you’re succeeding,” Dick said swiftly. “We’ve
got them going, and now we want to hold them from
making a score.”</p>

<p class='c002'>In the track house, Fullerton gave the boys a short,
pithy talk, cautioning them not to lose their grip
now that they had scored, and to bend every energy
toward keeping the crimson line away from the goal.
There was a vast deal of rubbing lame shoulders,
ankles, and wrists, until the rooms fairly reeked with
witch-hazel and arnica; a perfect babel of excited talk
and speculation and laughter; and then they trotted out
to the field again and took their places on the gridiron.</p>

<p class='c002'>Dale Sparkfair made good his joking words to Merriwell
by means of as pretty a round-the-end dash as
had ever been seen on the field, and then it was Harvard’s
turn to let loose their pent-up flood of enthusiasm.
More than one undergraduate—and staid
alumnus as well—could not speak above a whisper for
a good many hours.</p>

<p class='c002'>The third quarter ended with the scores even. The
excitement had risen to a fever heat. With only fifteen
minutes of play left, what was going to be the
result? Would the game remain a tie? That seemed
incredible, and yet it looked to a good many as though
it would be the case.</p>

<p class='c002'>The brief intermission was almost over. The spectators
settled back into their seats and the cheering
started in once more. The sun was almost behind the
west corner of the stand. The shadows were lengthening
and a brisk, sharp wind, straight from the Sound,
caused overcoat collars to be turned up and furs to
be drawn closely around fair necks. From the
crowded tiers of seats came the steady tramp-tramp
of chilled feet, hinting their owners’ impatience.</p>

<p class='c002'>The players took their places; the breathless silence
was suddenly split by the shrilling of the referee’s
whistle, and the battle was resumed.</p>

<p class='c002'>Jack Kenny played the game during that last quarter
as he had never played before. His clever work
rose to the point of brilliancy, for the winning of
that game had become an absolute monomania with
him. He felt that in no other way could he make up
for his behavior of the past week, which had come so
perilously near bringing disaster upon his beloved
college.</p>

<p class='c002'>It would be a triumph indeed if he could personally
make another run for the blue, but he felt that such
a thing was too much to hope for.</p>

<p class='c002'>But brilliant as was his manœuvring, which was
ably seconded by every man on the team, the splendid
work of Harvard made it barren of results. They
were evidently determined that, if they could not score
again, neither should their opponents; and the hands
of the big clock above the stand moved inexorably forward
without either side having the advantage.</p>

<p class='c002'>Desperately Kenny tried every trick at his command,
without avail. Back and forth surged the gasping,
ragged, tattered lines of men, battling in those last
few minutes as if their very lives, and more, depended
on their efforts.</p>

<p class='c002'>The vast throng of spectators were thrilled into silence
so absolute that it seemed almost as if they had
ceased breathing, as they bent forward with staring
eyes riveted on the field, oblivious to all else but the
struggle taking place before them.</p>

<p class='c002'>There were but four minutes left when the quarter
back suddenly ripped out a signal and snatched the ball
from Baulsir. This time he did not pass it, but darted
toward the left end. Tempest sprang forward and
swung in beside him; the left tackle and end interfered
strenuously as the crimson line plunged forward.</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny ran as he had never run before, and Tempest
kept pace with him barely a few feet away. In an
instant they had cleared the opposing guard and tackle,
running free with only the full back and left half in
the way.</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny thrilled with joy and exultation. His chance
had come. Tempest would take care of the half back,
and, somehow, he could manage to get past the other.
He would make a goal and win the game. Thus his
self-respect would be restored and reparation made
for his amazing folly.</p>

<p class='c002'>But swiftly on the heels of this thought came another.
What of Tempest? If he made goal the fellows
would think that he had been right all along and
the captain wrong. Would that be the sort of reparation
he had wished to make? Would it be the really
generous thing to do? There was but a second in
which to answer the question, for the half back was almost
upon them.</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny stumbled suddenly, and uttered a sharp, stifled
cry.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Quick, Don!” he gasped. “Take it!”</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest was not slow. Without hesitating an instant,
he caught the pigskin skillfully and sped on;
Kenny recovered himself with amazing swiftness and
lunged toward the Harvard half. A moment later
they rolled to the ground together, while the man with
the ball flew on toward the beckoning goal posts.</p>

<p class='c002'>By the time the quarter back had staggered to his
feet Tempest had passed the full back. An instant later
he crossed the line and pandemonium broke loose.</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny felt a lump in his throat as he heard Tempest’s
name hurled across the field in great crashes of
sound which thrilled him to the very core. It might
have been his own, but he did not care.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m glad I did it,” he muttered. “It was the decent
thing to do.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Then he remembered that he ought to limp a little
to account for his stumble, and promptly developed a
very realistic lameness, which lasted until they were
going back to the track house, surrounded by a yelling,
shouting, capering mob of fellows, who had poured
out of the stands and presently insisted on hoisting
every one of the players up on their shoulders and carrying
them on their way in triumph.</p>

<p class='c002'>Tempest headed the procession, and it was his name
which sounded most frequently from the mouths of
the triumphant marching throngs. The quarter back
would have been more than human had he not felt a
momentary longing to be in the captain’s place, but
he quickly smothered it.</p>

<p class='c002'>“I’m glad!” he muttered emphatically—he might
have shouted the words aloud and no one would have
heard him. “I’d do it again, too. I’ve been dirty mean
to Don, but this sort of squares us up.”</p>

<p class='c002'>Reaching the track house, he slipped lightly to the
ground and started to go inside.</p>

<p class='c002'>All at once he felt a hand on his shoulder, and, turning
swiftly, looked into Dick Merriwell’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“That was a clever pass, Jack,” the latter said
quietly. “Did you hurt your ankle much?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny flushed and dropped his eyes.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not very,” he returned, in a low tone. “I—I stumbled,
and—er—er——”</p>

<p class='c002'>“I thought it couldn’t be very bad,” Merriwell put
in quickly. “You seem to have gotten over it pretty
soon.”</p>

<p class='c002'>“It wasn’t so very bad,” the quarter back answered.
“But I didn’t want to run any chances, so I passed the
ball to Don.”</p>

<p class='c002'>There was a momentary pause, during which the
slim fellow seemed to find an absorbing interest in arranging
with his foot three loose pebbles in a triangle.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You old bluffer!” Merriwell exclaimed suddenly.</p>

<p class='c002'>With a gasp, Kenny raised his head and looked
straight into Dick’s eyes, which were watching him
with an expression of satisfaction and perfect friendship.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Wh-what do you mean?” the quarter back faltered
weakly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Just what I say,” retorted Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>He threw one arm over Kenny’s shoulder and smiled.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You’re an old bluff!” he repeated. “There wasn’t
an earthly thing the matter with you out there. You
stumbled on purpose to give Don the ball and let him
make the goal. It was a corking thing to do, Jack, and
not one fellow in a thousand could have brought himself
to it. Didn’t you start out with the idea of making
it yourself?”</p>

<p class='c002'>Kenny nodded slowly.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Yes,” he said, in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c002'>“But you saw your chance, and you’ll never regret
it,” Dick went on softly. “You’ve evened up the score
with Tempest now, and the fellows will never have a
chance to say that you were right and he was wrong.
It was generous, Jack, and I’m proud of you.”</p>

<p class='c002'>A keen sense of pleasure and satisfaction thrilled
Kenny to the heart. Suddenly he looked anxiously at
Merriwell.</p>

<p class='c002'>“You won’t tell Don?” he questioned hastily.</p>

<p class='c002'>“Not I!” laughed Dick.</p>

<p class='c002'>His arm still about the quarter back’s shoulder, he
turned, and together they disappeared into the track
house.</p>

<p class='c016'>who handles the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS
is a man worth patronizing. The fact that he
does handle our books proves that he has considered
the merits of paper-covered lines, and
has decided that the STREET &amp; SMITH

<p class='c002'>He has looked into the question of the morality
of the paper-covered book, for instance, and
feels that he is perfectly safe in handing one of
our novels to any one, because he has our assurance
